The supplied "sign-nbi.pl" file handles NBI signing for method [0] (signature
stored in NBI headers, key in source code). It knows several ways of calling:

sign-nbi.pl gen
	Generate an openssl rsa key, 512 bits length. Stored to ".KEY" in current
	directory, with permissions 0600.
sign-nbi.pl code
	Enters the Key Information into "include/safeboot_key.h" - so be sure to call
	this only from inside the etherboot "src" directory
	.KEY must be present in current directory
sign-nbi.pl sign <filename>
	Reads <filename> and enters the signature into bytes 446-509
	.KEY must be present in current directory
