This is tftp-hpa-0.13; this version was put out by H. Peter Anvin
<hpa@zytor.com>.

Changes in 0.13:

	Added the non-standard option "blksize2".  The "blksize"
	option is limited in its usability, since TFTP is designed to
	be implemented in a ROM, and ROM code might find it painful to
	deal with packets that don't meet certain alignment
	restrictions.

	The "blksize2" option tells the server that the block size
	must be a power of 2 to be usable to the client.  The server
	SHALL respond with a block size that is a power of two, up to
	a maximum of 32768, or reject the option.  Furthermore, the
	server SHALL grant a block size that is no smaller than 512
	bytes unless the client explicitly requested a smaller block
	size.  If the client request both options, the server MAY
	accept one or the other, but not both.  At some point I will
	probably write up an IETF draft for this option.


General information on the tftp-hpa series:

This is a conglomerate of a number of versions of the BSD TFTP code,
ported to Linux, although it should work on mostly any POSIX-compliant
OS with sockets.

The core software was taken from OpenBSD (CVS source as of
1999-09-21).  I believe this was the most secure source base available
at the time I obtained this code, and it included support for the -s
and -c options.

The un-BSD-ized Makefiles and a lot of the configure macros were taken
from netkit-tftp-0.10 by David Holland; I also followed this example
and modernized the code style throughout.

Patches by Markus Gutschke and Gero Kuhlmann were the basis for the
option negotiation as well as the "blksize" and "tsize" option
support, although I made a fair amount of mostly stylistic changes to
their code.

Adding the -r option (disable a specific option), the "timeout"
option, and converting to using autoconf for setup was my own code, as
are any bugs introduced in this merge, and any features added to the
Changes list.
