Client
------

* In tftp_receive_file, if we receive twice the same block, what's happening?
* Add tab completion.
* Implement a more complete status reporting, incuding size of the transfer
  and transfer rate.

Server
------

* Fixe all possible buffer overflow (strcat, strcpy...)
* In option negociation, maybe we should only ignore option with invalid
  value. Currently we reply with an error.

Both
----
* Support for options (multicasting)
* Support IPv6

* Add netascii and octet transfer support.
/*
 * fill the input buffer, doing ascii conversions if requested
 * conversions are  lf -> cr,lf  and cr -> cr, nul
 */
/*
 * Output a buffer to a file, converting from netascii if requested.
 * CR,NUL -> CR  and CR,LF => LF.
 * Note spec is undefined if we get CR as last byte of file or a
 * CR followed by anything else.  In this case we leave it alone.
 */

* Modify logger.c to not duplicate fmt args
* Decide what to do when we got memory allocation failure

Generic
-------
* Add autoconf support
