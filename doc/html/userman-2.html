<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What is Etherboot?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Etherboot is a software package for creating ROM images that can
download code over an Ethernet network to be executed on an x86
computer. Many network adapters have a socket where a ROM chip can be
installed.  Etherboot is code that can be put in such a ROM. Etherboot
can also be booted from floppies (mainly for testing purposes but some
people have been known to use this all the time) and hard disk, as a
LILO/SYSLINUX compatible image, or from a hard disk partition.
<P>
<P>
<P>Etherboot requires the PC architecture, it does not work for other Linux
platforms such as Alphas or Suns. Typically the computer is diskless and
the code is Linux or FreeBSD, but these are not the only possibilities.
The code uses the bootp, tftp and NFS Internet Protocols, among others.
<P>
<P>
<P>For a somewhat out of date talk/tutorial type introduction to what
Etherboot does and how to set it up, see my 
<A HREF="diskless.html">SLUG talk</A>. You may wish to review this before reading further.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 What hardware is supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The following is the current NIC configuration file as of 2002-07-29.
<P>Even if your NIC does not appear in the list, it may still be supported
if the chip is one of those supported.  Many OEMs use chips from
foundries. An exhaustive list of brand names is impossible.  The best
strategy is to read the number on the LAN controller chip on the board.

# This is the config file for creating Makefile rules for Etherboot ROMs
#
# To make a ROM for a supported NIC locate the appropriate family
# and add a line of the form
#
# ROM           PCI-IDs         Comment
#
# ROM is the desired output name for both .rom and .lzrom images.
# PCI IDs are the PCI vendor and device IDs of the PCI NIC
# For ISA NICs put -
# Comment will be copied into config.c for display when detected
#
# All PCI ROMs that share a single driver are only built once (because they
# only have different PCI-IDs, but identical code).  ISA ROMS are built for
# each ROM type, because different vendors used a different logic around the
# basic chip.  The most popular example is the NS8390, which some cards use
# in PIO mode, some in DMA mode.  Two chips currently don't fit into this nice
# black-and-white scheme (the Lance and the NS8390).  Their driver deals
# with both PCI and ISA cards.  These drivers will be treated similarly to
# ISA only drivers by genrules.pl and are compiled for each ROM type that is
# ISA, and additionally compiled for the PCI card type.
#
# Then do: make clean, make Roms and make

# If your 3c900 NIC detects but fails to work, e.g. no link light, with
# the 3c90x driver, try using the 3c595 driver. I have one report that the
# 3c595 driver handles these NICs properly. (The 595 driver uses the
# programmed I/O mode of operation, whereas the 90x driver uses the bus
# mastering mode. These NICs are capable of either mode.) When it comes to
# making a ROM, as usual, you must choose the correct image, the one that
# contains the same PCI IDs as your NIC.

<P>All Etherboot drivers are autoprobing, which means they attempt to
detect the hardware addresses at which the card is installed. It's
fairly easy to write a driver if you know C and are familiar with
Ethernet hardware interfacing. Please read the 
<A HREF="devman.html">developer manual</A> if you wish to do so.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="help"></A> <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Getting help</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Please join the 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/etherboot">Etherboot mailing lists</A>. These are listed on
the Etherboot home page. There is a users mailing list and a developers
mailing list. The users list is for issues with building and running the
software, while the developers list is for issues with features and
coding.
<P>
<P>
<P>Please post questions to the Etherboot mailing lists instead of mailing
me because: you get the benefit of a lot of experts seeing your question
(no, I don't know everything, if only because there are many
configurations I have never used); a lot of people see the question and
answer and this helps them too.  You will usually not get any reply from
me if you email questions to me directly. I want to make the best use of
my time and that is by making sure that as many people as possible see
the questions and answers. Note that I will post my replies to the
mailing lists so to see the answers you should subscribe, or be willing
to check the archives later.
<P>
<P>
<P>Other lists you can join are the Netboot mailing list (joining details
on Etherboot home page), and the Linux Terminal Server Project mailing
lists at 
<A HREF="http://www.ltsp.org/">LTSP</A>.  The Etherboot
and Netboot lists are for general netbooting issues, while LTSP is
focused more on the LTSP packages. However there is a fair amount of
overlap between the lists and many key people are on all lists.
<P>
<P>
<P>Note that the Netboot mailing list is spam protected.  If your ISP has
been slack security-wise and had a machine of theirs get onto one of the
Open Relay Blacklists, then you will not be allowed to post. The only
things I can suggest are to change your ISP to a more responsible one,
or to get a Web based mailbox. I cannot help you with problems here as I
do not administer the Netboot mailing list.
