<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Building Etherboot</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>What do I need to build Etherboot?

<P>
<P>You need gcc, gas and objcopy, as well as any accompanying libraries and
include files. Generally speaking on a package based system using RPM
or PKG, you will need the C compiler package, the include file package,
the C library package, the assembler package and the binutils package
(this may include the assembler). In addition, if you intend to modify
the assembler files you will need an up-to-date as86 and ld86, not the
ones that come standard with Linux, but from the ELKS project; or you
will need nasm. You will also need perl if you modify the file NIC or
use a different RELOCADDR value in the Makefile than the default, and
m4 if you modify this file README.xsgml.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>I get an error from as saying data32 is an unknown directive.

<P>
<P>Your gas is too old, upgrade to 2.9.1 at least.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>I get an error from as saying data32 (and others) should be
prefixes.

<P>
<P>Support for extended directives changed in syntax between gas 2.9.1 and
gas 2.9.5. Disable -DGAS291 in Config to allow for the new syntax. In
recent versions of Etherboot, this should be automatically detected.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>The documentation talks about mknbi-linux and mknbi-dos. Where
are they?

<P>
<P>These are 
<A HREF="mknbi.html">utilities</A> in the mknbi-1.0
directory.  You need to cd into this directory, edit Makefile and run
make and make install to install the utilities in their final location.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Why don't you provide prebuilt ROM images?

<P>
<P>Etherboot is constantly updated, and binary images would get out of
date soon.  Binaries can lose any external indication of what release
they were from. Old binaries might float around and create problems for
users who are not aware that bugs have been fixed in newer versions. Also
there are some user configurable options you might want to change.
For this reason, Etherboot is provided in source form for you to build.
<P>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Testing Etherboot</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>I put the ROM image on floppy like you wrote (cat floppyload.bin.pre
bin32/foo.rom > /dev/fd0, or make bin32/foo.fd0) but the floppy prints
out hex numbers when it boots.

<P>
<P>The floppy you use should be an error-free, preferably a recently
formatted floppy. Do not trust new floppies; they have been known to
lose their manufacturer formatting in storage. You don't need to put a
filesystem of any sort on it, FAT or ext2 or otherwise. Another possible
cause is that there are alignment differences between the drive used to
write the floppy and that used on the target machine. As far as I know
the floppy boot should work on all floppy sizes (1.44M, 720k, and even
1.2M and 360k if you can still find these), but beware of differences
between drives, e.g. writing a 360k floppy in a 1.2M drive creates narrow
tracks which may not overwrite previous contents.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>My network adapter is detected but I get no reply to the
BOOTP/DHCP request.

<P>
<P>Do you have a BOOTP or DHCP server running on the same Ethernet segment?
On many operating systems the server is not enabled by default. Review
the instructions in the Troubleshooting section. Another thing to
note is that the BOOTP (or DHCP in fixed address mode) server will not
reply if it does not know the network adapter's Ethernet address. Since
the address may be hard to determine if it is not printed on the card
or you do not have the adapter's setup program, you can copy it from
Etherboot's startup message. Remember to restart the server if you have
edited the config file and the server does not automatically reread when
it discovers an updated config file.
<P>
<P>
<P>Another thing to check is that the BOOTP or DHCP server is allowed
to receive the query. You may have some protection mechanism such as
tcpwrappers in front of it. As the booting computer does not have an
IP address, the request will come from 0.0.0.0 so your rules must allow
through packets from this address.
<P>
<P>
<P>If the BOOTP or DHCP server is on another Ethernet segment, things
get more complicated. You need to run a BOOTP or DHCP relay. You will
probably also need to set the gateway field in the reply so that TFTP
will work across the gateway. You should read a good explanation of how
these work, in say, W. Richard Steven's book TCP/IP Illustrated.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Etherboot gets the BOOTP/DHCP parameters but cannot find a
TFTP server.

<P>
<P>Do you have a TFTP server running and is it allowed to serve the client
in question? For example the tcpwrapper rules may not allow TFTPD to
respond to the IP address the booting computer is at. You should look
at the log files on the server for any clues.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>The TFTP server is found but it replies Access violation.

<P>
<P>Access violation is a blanket reply for many different problems but
essentially the TFTP server cannot give Etherboot the file requested. Did
you put the file where TFTPD expects to find it, e.g. on a directory
that is on its path? Did you make the file world readable? Case of the
filename is important too.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>I made this kernel and put it in /tftpdir like you
wrote but Etherboot says Unable to load file.

<P>
<P>Is the file a tagged image? You cannot use a ordinary kernel image, you
must process it with 
<A HREF="mknbi.html">mknbi-linux</A> first.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>I have this proprietary boot ROM and I used mknbi-linux to make a
tagged image, (or I got this tagged image from the LTSP project), but
the boot ROM doesn't load it, or it fails to run.

<P>
<P>Tagged image format is specific to Etherboot and Netboot. It will
not work with proprietary boot ROMs. You have to find out from the
supplier what boot procedures you should use. For example, if you are
using a Lanworks boot ROM, the infomation you need is 
<A HREF="http://www.3com.com/managedpc">here</A>.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Why don't you use some standard format instead of tagged image
format?

<P>
<P>First of all, tagged image format actually precedes many of the
proprietary formats in use today. So we were there first. Secondly
there is no acknowledged standard for the boot image format, although
there are some contenders now. Perhaps some day there will be an open,
widely-accepted format. Until then you have to aware that there are
different ones out there.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>What network cards are supported?

<P>
<P>See an earlier section in this README document.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>I have a machine with the X processor and Y megabytes of memory.
What can I expect to run on it?

<P>
<P>Please note that these estimates are approximate:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>On a 8088/8086 you can only boot ELKS, a 16-bit mini-version of
Linux, since 0.0.83 there has been support for making a tagged image
and a ramdisk. However there are few applications for ELKS. For more
details please go to the ELKS web site and mailing lists. Note that
there is no networking in ELKS yet.
</LI>
<LI>On a 286 you can run DOS. With 384kB of extended memory you can
run a 320kB ramdisk that can hold NCSA telnet with a VT100 terminal
emulation. With about 720kB of extended memory you can run DOS Kermit,
which has telnet capabilities and a VT320 terminal emulation. You can
run various small application and network services. See 
<A HREF="atnetboot.html">the AT netbooting document</A> and 
<A HREF="16.html">the 16-bit HOWTO</A> for some ideas.
</LI>
<LI>On a 386 with at least 4MB of memory you can boot Linux. With 4MB
perhaps only a few telnet sessions are possible. With 8MB you might be
able to run a text based web browser like Lynx or W3M.
</LI>
<LI>On a 486 with 16MB of memory you can run X to make an X-terminal.
</LI>
<LI>On a Pentium with 32MB of memory you can run an X-terminal and
some applications locally, say perhaps printing, daemons to control
devices, etc.
</LI>
<LI>On anything faster and with more memory you could perhaps do
distributed computation, e.g. a Beowulf cluster.

<OL>
<LI>The kernel loads but it cannot configure the network device.

<P>
<P>Did you compile the network adaptor driver into the kernel? Is the
network adaptor at an address that is probed by the driver? If not,
perhaps you need to provide some kernel parameters to help it find the
hardware.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>The kernel loads but it cannot mount a root filesystem, then it
asks me to insert a floppy.

<P>
<P>Did you build the kernel with the root on NFS option? You cannot use
a stock kernel from a distribution.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>The kernel loads but it cannot find a NFS server for the root
filesystem.

<P>
<P>Do you have a NFS server running and is it allowed to serve this client?
NFS is actually several services. On Linux at least you need: nfsd (either
kernel or userland version), rpc.mountd and portmapper. Check if the
tcpwrappers config file is allowing portmapper to receive the request.
Look at the log files for clues. Did we already mention that log files
are your friends?
<P>
</LI>
<LI>The root filesystem mounts but it says something about not being
able to open an initial console. Or alternatively, various services
complain about not being able to write to the filesystem.

<P>
<P>Please review the Troubleshooting section for what is required on this
root filesystem. The situation is complicated by the fact that there are
many possible ways of setting this up, including using a root filesystem
that is on ramdisk. If you wish to avoid many of the troubles, try using
a packaged solution such as 
<A HREF="http://www.ltsp.org/">LTSP</A>
or my shell scripts for creating a root filesystem by copying files from
an existing distribution.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>What is the recommended way of setting up the NFS root?

<P>
<P>There is no one true way, but several approaches. Network booting is a
tool and a very flexible one.  Here are just a few suggestions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>You can make a separate NFS root for each client, but share the
sharable files between clients using hard links to minimise disk space
requirements. This is the approach I took in 
<A HREF="diskless.html">my tutorial</A>. I used this because I was lazy, I have only a
couple of diskless clients and I could copy the files from an existing
distribution.
</LI>
<LI>You could use the packaged solution from 
<A HREF="http://www.ltsp.org/">LTSP</A>, which creates a shareable NFS root for
multiple clients.
</LI>
<LI>August H&ouml;randl describes 
<A HREF="http://elina.htlw16.ac.at/~hoerandl/nfs-root/">his approach</A> which uses a ramdisk for
the initial startup, and then merges in a readonly NFS filesystem.
</LI>
<LI>It is rumoured that the 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian distribution</A> has a package called diskless that
contains Perl scripts to create such a filesystem.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<P>
<P>If you have an approach which you think the world should know about,
please send the URL of a web page that describes it to 
<A HREF="mailto:ken_yap@users.sourceforge.net">me</A>.

<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 Running X</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>I tried to run X on the client but it aborted.

<P>
<P>Remember that the config files used by the X server should pertain
to the client's video adapter and display hardware. If you used a
<A HREF="http://www.ltsp.org/">LTSP</A> package, please review
the configuration directions. If you used the copy files from server
solution, then you need to customise the X server configuration. Another
thing that may cause the server to abort is lack of a mouse device.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>X -query server runs but all I get is a gray stippled screen.

<P>
<P>Either you don't have an XDM server running on the server machine or
it is not allowed to serve this client. In the latter case check XDM's
Xaccess file, because for security reasons, the ability for clients to
connect is usually disabled.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>When I am logged in using an X-terminal, I find that the floppy
drive, sound card and name of the computer are those of the server!?

<P>
<P>This is to be expected! This is exactly how an X-terminal works. You
are indeed logged onto the server and the client just provides
display (screen) and input device (keyboard and mouse) services to the
application. This is one of the beauties of the X Windowing system model,
it's <I>network transparent</I>.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>So how do I run applications on the client? I have this (smartcard
reader, printer, sound card, etc) program that must execute locally.

<P>
<P>Some client configurations allow you to run applications locally, in
addition to running them on the server. In fact the printer and sound
daemons mentioned later are applications that are run on the client.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>X applications cannot find (some) fonts.

<P>
<P>Do you have an X font server (XFS) running on the server machine, is it
allowed to serve this client, and has the client been told to use the
font server? The last point is usually configured in the XF86Config file,
or by a xset command to modify the font path after logging in.
<P>
<P>
<P>Also note that RedHat (and possibly other distributions) has made XFS
by default serve only the local machine using a Unix socket.  You need
to modify the startup script to tell XFS to use a TCP/IP socket.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>How much CPU power and memory do I need on the client? On the
server?

<P>
<P>It depends on the configuration. There are two major cases: where the
client is an X-terminal, and not much more; and where the client is
configured to run applications locally.
<P>
<P>
<P>An X server will fit in 16MB of memory, and 32MB is quite adequate.
Performance depends on the CPU, video card and your expectations.
An old Pentium 200 with a PCI video card does very well, but if you are
not fussy, a high-end 486 with a VLB video card can be satisfying too.
<P>
<P>
<P>If you want to run apps locally, well how long is a piece of string?
Netscape will need say another 16MB. It all depends. Whatever you do,
it's worth trimming down on the services you run on the client. Don't
run more virtual consoles than you need and don't run unneeded daemons.
<P>
<P>
<P>As for the server, in the X-terminal case this has all the applications
running on it, so it should be adequate for the multiuser aspect. A
high-end Pentium, with 64 MB of memory to start with, and between 8 and
16MB for each extra client is a good starting point. It will also depend
on your mix of client access, statistically perhaps not everybody will
be running at the same time. Remember that you don't have to have one
big server for all your clients, you can and you should distribute the
load across servers.

<LI>How can I print to a printer attached to a diskless client?

<P>
<P>There is a server program called p910nd at the Etherboot site (and
improved versions of it at 
<A HREF="http://www.ltsp.org/">LTSP</A>)
that funnels data from a TCP/IP connection to the printer port. You
can instruct lpd or 
<A HREF="http://www.cups.org/">CUPS</A> on the
server to send jobs across the network to p910nd.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>How can I output sound on the client?

<P>
<P>There is a package called 
<A HREF="http://www.solucorp.qc.ca">virtualfs</A> that proxies the sound devices across
the network. It can also proxy the floppy drive.

<PRE>
6.4 Using your mainboard's BIOS to integrate etherboot-code

Newer mainboards that have an AWARD-BIOS can use etherboot without
seperate EPROMS and therefore without the necessity of having a
EPROM-programmer[?]. (Heinrich Rebehn wishes to add: Flashing the BIOS
is always a (small) risk. Flashing with unsupported, hacked BIOS image
is *dangerous* and may render your PC unbootable.  If you don't
have access to a PROM burner you should stay away from experimenting.) In
order to do this, you need 2 software tools: awdflash.exe, which should be
included in your mainboard package, and cbrom.exe, which is an OEM-tool
that allows modifications of the BIOS. awdflash.exe reads and writes
the flashrom content, whereas cbrom.exe is used to analyze the content
of the AWARD BIOS image. cbrom.exe can also add code to the BIOS image
or remove components.  This way you can easily integrate etherboot into
your mainboards without even opening the PC's case.

After the BIOS image has been saved (e.g. as bios.bin), or in case the
current version of the BIOS has been copied from the board manufacturer's
website, 'cbrom bios.bin /d' shows how much space is left on the image
for your code.

As the flashrom holds the compressed BIOS, cbrom will also compress
the code when adding it to the BIOS.  Therefore, 8 to 20 kbyte of free
memory is needed, depending on the network adapter's driver. In case not
enough memory is left, unneeded BIOS components can be removed from the
BIOS image to regain space: the manufacturer's logo or the Symbios/NCR
SCSI-code are note needed for diskless systems. 'cbrom bios.bin
/[pci|ncr|logo|isa] release' will remove those unnessary components.

The command line "cbrom bios.bin /[pci|isa] bootimg.rom [D000:0]" adds
the compiled etherboot code to the bios. bootimg.rom is the code we
would use to burn onto EEPROMs in other cases. Depending on your network
card, either the pci or isa options have to be used. With isa cards
you have to tell cbrom to which RAM location the code will be extracted
at boot time. Attention: Compile the etherboot with the -DASK_BOOT or
-DEMERGENCYDISKBOOT option to be able to access a disk. The code added
by cbrom will be executed before the computer seeks for a boot disk
or floppy.

6.5 Booting with a DOS executable (COM) file

If the computer has to be used with more than one operating systems,
for example using the computer as an X-Terminal in addition to the
already installed NT on the harddrive, etherboot has to be used with
the compile-time option -DASK_BOOT. In case hardware-conflicts beetween
Windows NT and the installed EPROM exist, creating DOS Executables
(e.g. using 'make rtl8139.com') can provide a useful remedy. Those DOS
Executables are comparable in their functionality to .rom images and
can be used as substitutes.

In case an existing DOS-bootsector, stored in BOOTSECT.DOS, cannot be
used, creating one has to be done by formatting and installing a harddrive
using DOS before installing NT (see Win-NT Multiboot-HOWTO). In addition
the DOS system files are needed (IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, or KERNEL.SYS
when using Freedos) and have to be copied into the directory of the
NT loader. If using Autoexec.bat to start the .COM file is desired,
either the particluar COMMAND.COM has to be provided or the etherboot
file needs to be renamed as COMMAND.COM. This file will then be started
instead of the DOS-Shell which is useful for avoiding unwanted user
interaction. Afterwards a line has to be added to BOOT.INI as if DOS
was to be booted:

[boot loader]
timeout=20
default=C:\bootsect.dos #add this line if dhcp/tftp should be default action
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\WINNT="Windows NT Workstation, Version 4.0"
[VGA-Modus]" /basevideo /sos
C:\bootsect.dos="DHCP/TFTP (Linux diskless via etherboot)" #our boot option

<P>And here are some comments by Rapp Informatik Systeme GmbH about
cbrom.exe versions:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
Some  more remarks  for cbrom..

There are several version numbers of cbrom.exe  p.e. 1.x  and 2.x.
and there is a cbrom called cbrom6.exe.  First cbrom.exe with Version
1.x  (newest 1.32)  is for Award Bios Version 4.5x   and cbrom6.exe is
for Award Bios Version 6.xx.

So because it seems a lot people become confused  and use cbrom 1.x
for the new 6.x  Bios Award merged this together  to a cbrom.exe   with
Version number 2.x ( newest know 2.04) witch now runs on Award 4.5x and
6.xx Bioses.

Now how to find cbrom.exe.  Different  1.x Versions  of cbrom.exe
could be found  on the net, cbrom6.exe  seems to be gone.  It seems
that Award/Phoenix do all that cbrom is deleted from servers of board
manufaktures.  So cbrom.exe Vers 2.04  is not  available on the net.
If  somebody need this please try to send a demand question to the list -
I hope somebody will mail it to you.

<LI>How do I enable the ROM socket on my network adapter? There are
no jumpers on the card.

<P>
<P>These jumperless cards need a card-specific utility program to enable
the ROM. Normally the manufacturer supplies it on a diskette or CDROM.
You lost the diskette? If you know the manufacturer, you might be able
to get the program from their website. You have a mystery card? Well the
first thing to do is to identify the card. If it is an ISA card and made
in Taiwan or China it's almost certainly a NE2000 clone. For some
information, try

<LI>I would like to boot my laptop diskless from a floppy containing
Etherboot.

<P>
<P>The problem is that laptops these days use PCMCIA network adapter cards.
These in turn connect to the PCMCIA controller when docked. To be able to
communicate with the PCMCIA card, Etherboot would first have to talk
to the PCMCIA controller. Until somebody writes the code to do this...
Booting from disk is different because the kernel will load the PCMCIA
controller code from disk first. You could always put a Linux kernel on
the boot floppy.

<LI>There is no Etherboot driver for my network adapter. Can you write
me one?

<P>
<P>If I were independently wealthy and had nothing else to do in life, sure!
But unfortunately I have a day job and Etherboot is a hobby. A couple
of the drivers were written for pay and the others were written by
volunteers. Perhaps you might like to volunteer?  If you have a good
grasp of C, and understand basic hardware concepts, it is quite doable,
and not nearly as difficult as writing a Linux device driver.  See the
section on 
<A HREF="README-9.html#driver">Writing an Etherboot Driver</A>. You
will have the reward of understanding hardware intimately and seeing
your work benefit users worldwide.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>I see that my network adapter is supported in Linux. Can I use the
Linux driver in Etherboot? Or maybe you can adapt the Linux source. I
can send you the file if you just say the word.

<P>
<P>No, the structure of Linux and Etherboot drivers are quite different.
There are several reasons: Linux drivers are more complicated and written
to give good performance, whereas Etherboot drivers are written to be
simple. Linux drivers are interrupt driven, whereas Etherboot drivers
are polling. Linux drivers have an elaborate support structure, whereas
Etherboot drivers are fairly self-standing. Finally Etherboot drivers
have a difficult constraint on the amount of memory available to it,
about 32kB near the top of 640kB.
<P>
<P>
<P>But... you can use Linux drivers as a source of reverse-engineering
information. Several of the drivers in Etherboot were adapted from
Linux drivers. But don't send me the file; see previous FAQ about
volunteering. And I have the latest Linux source anyway, doesn't everyone?

<LI>I have a question not covered by this list.

<P>
<P>Please join the 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/etherboot">Etherboot mailing lists</A>. These are listed on the
Etherboot home page.
<P>
<P>
<P>Other lists you can join are the Netboot mailing list (joining details
on Etherboot home page), and the LTSP mailing lists at 
<A HREF=" http://www.ltsp.org/">LTSP</A>.  Etherboot and Netboot lists are for
general netbooting issues, while LTSP is focused more on the LTSP
packages. However there is a fair amount of overlap between the lists
and many key people are on all lists.
<P>
<P>
<P>Posting to a list is preferable to mailing me because: you get the
benefit of a lot of experts seeing your question (no, I don't know
everything, if only because there are many configurations I have never
used); if your question is answered, a lot of people see the answer and
this helps them too; and finally you may not get an immediate (or any)
reply from me because I may be not reading my email or on holiday or
just plain grumpy :-).
<P>
<P>
<P>Note that the Netboot mailing list is spam protected.  If your ISP has
been slack security-wise and had a machine of theirs get onto one of the
Open Relay Blacklists, then you will not be allowed to post. The only
things I can suggest are to change your ISP to a more responsible one,
or to get a Web based mailbox.
