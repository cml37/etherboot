<H2><A NAME="s3">3. PC ARCHITECTURE</A></H2>

<P>
<P>The PC architecture was never designed with security considerations in
mind.  Running an operating system such  as DOS or Windows, allows the
user full  control over the hardware.  There are no effective measures
for preventing him from modifying  data on local mass storage devices,
reading confidential  data that is  stored locally,  installing trojan
horses  and programs  that  intercept user  input, monitoring all data
packets that are sent on the  local ethernet segment, sending ethernet
packages with  faked  authorization information,  and  a whole  lot of
other potentially dangerous actions.
<P>
<P>
<P>Modern operating systems  and suitable hardware  extensions make these
attacks more  difficult, but  as long as   the user can   still launch
arbitrary programs  that have full hardware access,  there is not much
protection  that  can be  achieved in this  way.   Therefore, the most
important security measures  are  those that prevent a  malicious user
from executing programs from arbitrary external sources.
<P>
<P>
<P>The PC  must  be physically  protected, so  that  there is  no  way of
replacing  the harddrive  (either  for  reading  its contents  or  for
installing compromised software), installing   a modified system  BIOS
(if your system  has a Flash  BIOS, then make sure  that it  is always
write protected and that write protection actually works!), connecting
it   to  a different  network,  removing   extra hardware  that offers
security features, or performing some other hardware modification.
<P>
<P>
<P>If the PC offers exchangeable mass storage devices (floppy, ZIP drive,
CD-ROM,  ...), the system must be  configured to never boot from these
devices.
<P>
<P>
<P>This is not as easy as it might  sound.  Most motherboards come with a
system BIOS which offers  back-doors to their password. So configuring
the BIOS to never boot from exchangeable devices, will not prevent any
determined hacker from   modifying  this setting.  These   generically
accepted passwords might not be  known to your  average users, but you
can assume that even  a poorly informed  hacker will know about  them.
Besides, if your  system allows for  reading the contents of  the CMOS
memory chip (e.g. by starting a suitable DOS program such the debugger
which  ships with  DOS), then the  password  can be computed from this
data. While you should  still make sure,  that your BIOS  has password
protection, this is only to be considered as a mild deterrent.
<P>
<P>
<P>A  more useful protection  is  achieved by installing extra  firmware,
which requires  a password before booting from  a  local device.  This
firmware  should  be written in a  way  which prevents the system BIOS
from   disabling   it.  This is    the default  configuration  for the
"etherboot" BOOT-Prom, but it   might still be circumvented,   if your
system BIOS  allows   for disabling  certain  memory  areas from being
scanned for ROMs.   If this is the case,  then complain to your system
vendor and replace  the machine; it is  unsuitable for being used in a
publically  accessible   place.     Also, in   a   security  conscious
environment, there must be no way of  escaping from the control of the
BOOT-Prom;  this   means,     that  you    must     not enable     the
"-DEMERGENCYDISKBOOT" option  when compiling the  "etherboot" software
and you must  never offer an empty image  name in the image menu (c.f.
README.VendorTags).  If you want to offer booting from a local device,
then specify the full  device name  and  either enable  the "-DFLOPPY"
option or  store a boot image  (as  generated by "mknbi-blkdev") under
this name on the TFTP server.
<P>
<P>
<P>It might  be a  good  idea to  install non-functional bootcode  in the
master  boot record of your harddisk  and install any locally required
boot code  in   the boot sectors of   the  individual partitions. Both
"etherboot" and "mknbi-blkdev" know how  to boot from partitions  such
as  "/dev/hda1" (first primary partion)  or "/dev/hdb5" (first logical
partion on the second harddrive).
<P>
<P>
<P>If you have the choice, then do not offer operating systems which come
without   effective   password  protection   and  virtualization. This
basically rules out all of the following: DOS, Windows, Win95, ...
<P>
<P>
<P>You  should  be  aware of  the  fact,  that offering  one  "dangerous"
operating system,  makes all other    operating systems vulnerable  as
well.  A  noteworthy example is  the availability of tools which allow
an arbitrary DOS  user  to read and   modify the contents  of a  Linux
harddisk  partition   (similar  tools  are  supposedly  available  for
accessing NT partions).
