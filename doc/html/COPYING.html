<H1>Copying conditions</H1>

<H2>Markus Gutschke, <CODE>gutschk AT math PERIOD uni-muenster PERIOD de</CODE></H2>1 July 1997
<P><HR>
<EM>This explains the copyright conditions of the Etherboot package</EM>
<HR>
<P>
<P>The code, that I wrote for this package, basically consists of a set
of patches against existing code written by other authors. As part of
the existing code is covered by a BSD-style license whereas the other
part is covered by the GNU General Public License, mixing these
packages would cause conflicts between the two licenses. Fortunately,
you can clearly separate the two packages (all of the original code
for the BOOT-prom is covered by the BSD-style license, all of the
original code for creating the required Linux kernel images is covered
by GPL).
<P>
<P>
<P>As I did not intend to complicate things even more, I decided to
release my patches (note! this only applies my patches! it does not
mean, that either the copyright conditions for the original packages
or for the patched files are changed!) into the PUBLIC DOMAIN. This
means, I do not accept any responsibility for what my code does; the
patches are provided `as is' without warranty of any kind, either
expressed of implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
program is with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. On the
other hand, I do not claim any rights to this software other than the
right that I am acknowledged as the author of the patches.
<P>
<P>
<P>For information on the copyright conditions of the individual
packages/files please refer to the separate subdirectories. The
directory `src*' contains part of a FreeBSD source tree (you can
obtain the full source tree from a large selection of different FTP
servers), the directory `netboot-0.4' contains part of a package that
uses a different approach to disk-less loading of Linux kernels (you
can obtain the full package from sunsite in
pub/linux/system/Linux-boot/netboot-0.4.tar.gz). The directory `bin'
contains pre-compiled binaries; these binaries are derived from the
code in the `src*' directory and therefore share its copying
conditions. The directory 'patches' contains two patches `netboot*'
against the FreeBSD code (these two files are the only code written by
me; I hereby place them in the PUBLIC DOMAIN) and one patch that is
derived from the file `netboot-linux/lx-1.3.15.patch` and therefore
shares the GNU General Public License with that file. Most of these
patches are probably outdated by now.
<P>If you do not clearly understand the terms of this license or if you
want to report bugs, please contact me. (You could also send me a
postcard from your hometown, if you really like my code.) At the time
of writing my address is:
