<EM>This document describes the format and semantics of the VendorTags</EM>
<HR>
<P>
<P>This documentation has been written and is copyrighted 1996,97 by
Markus Gutschke &lt;gutschk@math.uni-muenster.de&gt;. You are
free to distribute this file as long as you do not change its
contents. I appreciate comments and will consider them in future
revisions. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions,
please also send carbon copies of your e-mail message to
both Ken Yap &lt;ken_yap@users.sourceforge.net&gt; and Gero Kuhlmann
&lt;gero@gkminix.han.de&gt;. I will happily include any of your
extensions, but I would like to avoid the proliferation of different
incompatible revisions of this document. If these conditions are a
problem to you, then feel free to contact me.
<P>
<P>
<P>RFC1533 allows for vendor-specific extensions to the BOOTP
protocol. It defines that all tags in the range 128 thru 254 are set
aside for site-specific extensions. Common implementations of "bootpd"
daemons can assign arbitrary null-terminated character strings to
these tags.
<P>
<P>
<P>This is a list of the tags that are currently used by the BOOT-Prom;
as a general rule, you should never fill out any of these entries,
unless you positively know that your BOOT-Prom supports the extension
or ignores this particular tag:
<P>
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>TAG 128</B><DD><P>this is a six-byte hexadecimal entry. The first four bytes
have to be the magic number E4 45 74 68; if this magic cannot
be found, then none of the other vendor tags are valid! The
fifth byte is the major version number and the sixth byte is
the minor version number of this protocol extension. The
current version is 0.0; the BOOT-Prom can assume that
incompatible changes increase the major version number. Mere
extensions to the existing protocol, increase the minor
version number. If the BOOT-Prom code has been written in a
way that anticipates future extensions, then it is acceptable
to honor the vendor tags even though, the minor version number
does not match exactly. Before making a change, that requires
updating the major version number, you should contact all of
the persons that are listed at the top of this document.
<P>
<DT><B>TAG 129</B><DD><P>the BOOT-Prom uses this tag for passing a user-provided
command line to the loaded operating system. As this tag is
used internally, the "bootpd" daemon must not assign any value
to it!
<P>
<DT><B>TAG 160</B><DD><P>a string that contains a colon separated list of
"parameter=value" pairs. Currently, these parameters are only
used to control the behavior of an interactive menu for
selecting different boot images; future extensions are quite
likely:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>timeout</B><DD><P>after this many seconds, the default image will be
loaded. If no 'timeout' has been set, then the
program will wait indefinitely.
<DT><B>default</B><DD><P>either an integer 'n' in the range 0 thru 15 or
192 thru 207, selecting the default image. If 'n'
is in the first range, it refers to the 'n'th menu
entry; if it is in the later range, it refers to
the entry with the tag number 'n'. This
distinction is important, if the list of images
contains gaps. If no value has been set, then the
image with the lowest tag number will be the
default image.
</DL>
<P>
<DT><B>TAGS 161 thru 175</B><DD><P>these tags are currently unused, but they should be allocated
for purposes that resemble the function of tag 160.
<P>
<DT><B>TAG 176</B><DD><P>the BOOT-Prom uses this tag for telling the loaded operating
system, which of the entries in tags 192 to 207 has been
selected by the user. As this tag is used internally, the
"bootpd" daemon must not assign any value to it!
<P>
<DT><B>TAGS 177 thru 183</B><DD><P>these tags are reserved for passing information from the
BOOT-Prom to the boot image. Under no circumstances should the
"bootpd" daemon assign any of these entries. The format of
these parameters is yet to be discussed.
<P>
<DT><B>TAGS 184 thru 191</B><DD><P>up to eight zero-terminated character strings can be used for
displaying a "message of the day". If you need to display more
than eight lines, you can embed suitable CR/LF pairs. If you
fully exploit that feature, you can display a complete 80x24
screen of information, but you should be aware that subsequent
output might scroll part of a long message.
<P>
<P>
<P>The BOOT-Prom can optionally be configured to interpret some
ANSI escape sequences. There also is an extension for
including extra data via TFTP; this overcomes the size
limitation of the tags 184-191.
<P>
<P>
<P>The ANSI emulation currently knows about these commands:

                              "col". They will  be drawn to  the right

                          you usually   do not  have   to enter  these
                          values manually, but you  should use  a tool
                          such as  "ppmtoansi" which  is  shipped with
                          your BOOT-Prom or available from the contrib
                          directory of the "etherboot" package.

                          bits. The first pixel is stored in the three
                          most  significant  bits  of the  first  data
                          byte.
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Note that you usually have to specify any control characters
directly (rather than in hex form) in your bootptab file.
<P>
<DT><B>TAGS 192 thru 207</B><DD><P>these tags define all of the valid boot images and override
any settings that are given with the "bf" bootfile option in
your "bootptab". It is allowed to leave gaps in the list.
This has an impact on how the `default' image will be
selected.
<P>All entries are of the form
<HR>
<PRE>
            label:server:gateway:filename:passwd:flags:cmdline
</PRE>
<HR>

For future extensibility, it is permitted to append an
arbitrary amount of other colon separated entries as long as
the limit of 255 characters per tag is not exceeded.
Non-existent entries can be left empty. This means that the
default value for this particular entry will be used. Trailing
colons can be omitted.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>label</B><DD><P>this is the text string that is displayed to the
user. It can contain arbitrary characters, except
for a colon. Embedding arbitrary control
characters is not recommended, but you might be
able to include ANSI escape sequences (if enabled
in the ROM) for changing text attributes as long
as you restore the attributes at the end of the
string. It probably does not make very much sense
to leave this entry empty.
<DT><B>server</B><DD><P>IP number of the TFTP server, where the image can
be found. This data has to be in decimal form
(e.g. 192.168.0.1); it is not permitted to use a
hostname. It is the responsibility of the "bootpd"
to look up hostnames. If this entry is omitted,
then the BOOTP server will be used for the TFTP
download.
<DT><B>gateway</B><DD><P>use this IP gateway, when accessing the boot image
by TFTP. If no value is given, the BOOTP gateway
or alternatively the first entry in the list of
gateways "gw" is used.
<DT><B>filename</B><DD><P>name of the boot image that has to be loaded by
TFTP. If this entry is omitted, then the machine
boots locally from disk. If enabled in the
BOOT-Prom, you can specify pseudo-filenames for
booting from a local blockdevice (floppy,
harddisk, ...); these filenames have to match the
pattern "/dev/[fh]d*". If the BOOT-Prom does not
have support for these pseudo-filenames, you can
still boot from blockdevices by storing an boot
image as generated by mknbi-blkdev under the name
of the desired blockdevice (symbolic links will
do). In Etherboot 4.6.2 and later, a - in this field
means use the filename specified in the BOOTP/DHCP reply.
This saves on menu size.
<DT><B>passwd</B><DD><P>MD5 message digest of the password. If this entry
is omitted, then no password is required for
loading this image. Support for passwords is
optional and might not be compiled into the ROM
image. For generating the MD5 message digest, you
can use freely available tools such as
"md5sum". C.f. the flags entry for controlling
the behavior of passwords.
<DT><B>flags</B><DD><P>flags are used for controlling some aspects of how
the BOOT-Prom code behaves. All flags are a string
of decimal digits followed by a letter; multiple
flags can be concatenated. If this entry is
omitted, then a default value of "1i1p" is
assumed. Currently, these flags are defined:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>0i</B><DD><P>booting this image does not require a
password; the contents of the password
entry is ignored unless some other feature
(such as the flag "2p") requires it.
<DT><B>1i</B><DD><P>booting this image requires a password. If
the password entry is omitted, or no
password support is available in the
BOOT-Prom, then this flag is ignored.
<DT><B>0p</B><DD><P>the user cannot enter a command line for
passing parameters to the loaded image,
even if this feature has been enabled when
compiling the BOOT-Prom. N.B. this does not
affect the cmdline entry as described
below!
<DT><B>1p</B><DD><P>the user does not get prompted for passing
parameters to the loaded image, but he can
explicitly request the prompt (e.g. by
pressing a modifier key while selecting an
image from the menu). If the password
entry is not omitted, then the password has
to be entered. Both parameter passing and
password validation can be disabled when
compiling the BOOT-Prom.
<DT><B>2p</B><DD><P>the user always gets prompted for passing
parameters to the loaded image. If the
password entry is present and password
support has been enabled in the BOOT-Prom,
then the password has to be entered.
<DT><B>3p</B><DD><P>the user always gets prompted for passing
parameters to the loaded image. No password
is required.
</DL>
<P>
<DT><B>cmdline</B><DD><P>the contents of this entry is appended to the end
of the command line that gets passed to the loaded
image. This feature is unaffected by the "p"
flags. Passing parameters currently does not make
sense for any operating system other than Linux
and is silently ignored for other operating
systems. As it is not legal to enter colons as
part of an entry, you have to escape them by
writing "~c" instead. This also means, that all
tilde characters have to be escaped by writing
"~~". As some bootp daemons do not allow for
entering a backslash in a character string, the
escape sequence "~b" inserts a backslash
character. Currently, all other escape sequences
are undefined.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
</DL>
<P>For demonstration purposes, I attached an annotated excerpt from my
"bootptab" illustrating some of these techniques. In the following
the character sequence <CODE>ESC</CODE> should be replaced by the ASCII
escape character. Also the 8-bit characters have been changed to 7-bit
approximations due to SGML tool limitations. To get the original codes,
use this table: top left corner, char 201 (decimal); horizontal bar,
char 205; top right corner, char 187; vertical bar, char 186; bottom
left corner, char 200; bottom right corner, char 188.

# The MOTD (message of the day) can contain arbitrary characters, that
# the PC is capable of displaying.  Here we use 8bit characters for
# drawing a border around the message; also we change the foreground
# color to red (this assumes that the BOOT Prom has support for ANSI
# escape sequences):

# Alternatively, the MOTD can be stored in an external file; this

# We use the "template" feature of modern versions of "bootp" in order

#
# All entries are kept as generic as possible.  This ensures that they

# the server IP address and the gateway IP address empty, should
# ensure that booting works even when we go thru "bootpgw" gateways.

# "Technicolor" special effects are achieved by changing the

You can use a descriptive name instead of option-nnn if you like.

<P>If you only have old BOOT-Proms and want to use these advanced
features without having to burn new BOOT-Proms, there is a little
trick.
<P>
<P>
<P>You may have noticed that old BOOT-Proms ignore all of these vendor
extensions and unconditionally load the file that is given in the "bf"
bootfile entry. On the other hand, new BOOT-Proms completely ignore
the "bf" entry when they find a list of images in the vendor extension
tags.
<P>
<P>
<P>Therefore, you create a boot image that contains the new BOOT-Prom
code and specify the filename in the "bf" entry. This results in a two
step bootloading process. First the old BOOT-Prom loads the new code
and then the new code displays the message of the day, processes the
image list, asks the user for his preferred image (and possibly for
parameters and a password) and then proceeds booting.
