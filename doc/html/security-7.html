<P>
<P>The ethernet is extremly  vulnerable to attacks from malicious  users.
Anybody who can gain direct access to an  ethernet segment, can easily
monitor all traffic  and inject forged  data.  This is very dangerous,
because many protocols transfer  data either  un-encoded or in  easily
decipherable form.   Also,   authorization  is  often  based   on  the
assumption that the return address or a session id can be trusted, but
this is no longer true if users gain unlimited access to the ethernet;
it does not    really matter if  this  access  is achieved  by  having
physical control over part of the  network or by running a compromised
or inherently insecure  operating  system.  There are  various attacks
from  machines  that  are not  directly  connected   to your  ethernet
segment, but the majority  of them can be  prevented by installing and
maintaining a properly configured firewall.  For more information, you
should regularly monitor security related newsgroups and mailinglists.
