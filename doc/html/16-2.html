<P>
<P>That's right, but Linux/ELKS eventually will.  Not that it will be ever
the same as the Linux you love.  So Etherboot would be useful for booting
those over the network. After all, embedded apps for XTs and ATs are one
goal of Linux/ELKS. It might also be useful for netbooting other OSes,
but you have to figure out how yourself.
