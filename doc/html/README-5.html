<P>
<P>What about DOS? The deal with DOS is that one is loading a virtual
floppy called A: into extended memory and then booting from this floppy.
So you have to capture an image of a bootable DOS floppy first.  Some
more details can be found in the 
<A HREF="mknbi.html">mknbi-dos</A>
utility.
<P>
<P>
<P>I have booted DOS (both M$ versions up to 5.0 and DR versions up to
7.03) diskless this way.  A 
<A HREF="mknbi.html">mknbi-fdos</A> is
available for building tagged images for booting FreeDOS, the procedure
differs slightly from booting M$ or DR DOS. Note that extended memory is
used so that rules out 086/088 computers but 286s are ok. See 
<A HREF="atnetboot.html">this document</A> for more details.
<P>
<P>
<P>If you were thinking of booting a Windows machine via the network, it
seems (I'm not masochistic enough to do this) the problem is not the
network booting but the mounting of a file system over NetBIOS (Windows
does not do remote mounts of root filesystems over NetBIOS on TCP). So
that rules out a Samba server. It appears to be possible over a Netware
server, for which Linux or FreeBSD has workalikes. Also it is said that
only certain versions of Windows will allow diskless booting.  But then
what do you do about the networking stack? This situation may change
with with future Samba developments. But you will still have problems
with pathnames and the usual Windows hassles. Do you really want to do
this?  You do know that you can run lots of desktop applications like
Netscape, StarOffice, etc. on Linux, FreeBSD, etc. now?  In the 
<A HREF="http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/">Etherboot home page</A>,
there are links to external Web pages, one explaining how this was done
with a commercial TCP/IP boot ROM, another explaining how to do it using
Etherboot and Netbios over IPX. Good luck and send us your experiences
or better still a URL to a page explaining how you did it.
