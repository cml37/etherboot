<P>
<P>X provides some security when run over a network, but  the scope of it
is limited and exploits can easily be  devised. At the very least, you
should make sure that  the xauth  protocol  is used as opposed  to the
vastly  inferior xhost  protocol.  A better   solution is  provided by
routing all X connections through  a  secure shell session. This  does
not only provide  more  reliable authentication, but it  also encrypts
all data.
