<P>
<P>While NFS  is  very convenient  for  installing diskless  machines, it
provides  almost no  security.  Data  is transmitted  unencrypted  and
authorization is solely based on the identity of IP addresses. Anybody
who can forge ethernet packets, has full  access over any data that is
available via  NFS.  While there  are protocol  extension that try  to
address these shortcomings, I  am not aware  of any solution for Linux
based   machines. This means, you   have to  assume  that all exported
filesystems are freely read-  and  writeable. Bear  this in  mind when
deciding which data you intend to export.
