<P>
<P>What about DOS? The deal with DOS is that one is loading a virtual
floppy called A: into extended memory and then booting from this floppy.
So you have to capture an image of a bootable DOS floppy first.  Some
more details can be found in the 
<A HREF="mknbi.html">mknbi-dos</A>
utility.
<P>
<P>
<P>I have booted DOS (both M$ versions up to 5.0 and DR versions up to
7.03) diskless this way.  A 
<A HREF="mknbi.html">mknbi-fdos</A> is
available for building tagged images for booting FreeDOS, the procedure
differs slightly from booting M$ or DR DOS.
<P>
<P>
<P>If you were thinking of booting a Windows machine via the network, it
seems (I'm not masochistic enough to do this) the problem is not the
network booting but the mounting of a file system over NetBIOS (Windows
does not do remote mounts of root filesystems over NetBIOS on TCP). So
that rules out a Samba server. It appears to be possible over a Netware
server, for which Linux or FreeBSD has workalikes. Also it is said that
only certain versions of Windows will allow diskless booting.  You will
also have problems with pathnames and the usual Windows hassles. Do you
really want to do this?  You do know that you can run lots of desktop
applications like Mozilla, OpenOffice.org, etc. on Linux, FreeBSD, etc.
now? Why pay good money when you can use equally good free replacements?
Anyway if you are still determined, in the 
<A HREF="http://www.etherboot.org/">Etherboot home page</A>,
there are links to external Web pages, one explaining how this was done
with a commercial TCP/IP boot ROM, another explaining how to do it using
Etherboot and Netbios over IPX. A recent user experience is 
<A HREF="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/5299/0/8052616/">here</A>.
Good luck and send us your experiences or better still a URL to a page
explaining how you did it.
