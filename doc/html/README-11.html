<P>
<P>The boot code from FreeBSD is under the BSD license. The code taken from
the Linux PCI subsystem and Linux NIC drivers are under GPL. Some source
files have been put under GPL by their authors.  Hence the Etherboot
distribution is in general under the GPL, but you may use parts of it
derived from FreeBSD under FreeBSD rules.  Simply speaking, the GPL
says that if you distribute a binary derived from Etherboot code you
have to provide, or promise to provide on demand, the source code.
The full conditions of the GPL are specified in the file COPYING.

Files marked GPL may be used under the GPL. Files marked BSD may be used

GPL files are in general either from Linux or have been explicitly put
under GPL by the authors.
