<P>
<P>Whilst researching what other boot proms do (at least those implementing
TCP/IP protocols) it is clear that each 'does their own thing' in
terms of what they expect in a boot image.
<P>
<P>
<P>If we could all agree on working toward an open standard, O/S suppliers
and boot rom suppliers can build their products to this norm, and be confident
that they will work with each other.
<P>
<P>
<P>This is a description of how I will implement the boot rom for
Linux. I  believe it to be flexible enough for any OS that will be loaded
when a PC boots from a network in the TCP/IP environment.
<P>
<P>
<P>It would be good if this could be turned into some form of standard.
<P>
<P>
<P>This is very much a first draft. I am inviting comment.
<P>
<P>
<P>The ideas presented here should be independant of any implementation.
In the end, where there is a conflict between the final of this draft, and an
implementation, this description should prevail.
<P>
<P>
<P>The terms I use are defined at the end.

point where the net boot process gains control from the BIOS, to where
the booted image reaches a state from which there is no return to the
net boot program possible.<B>(gk)</B>
