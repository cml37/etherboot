<P>
<P>Like in bin32, two versions of the boot program for a given card will be
built in bin16, card.rom, and card.lzrom.  If you want to test from a floppy,
prepend floppyload.bin before writing raw to a blank floppy or use the
.fd0 targets in the Makefile. All this is just like the Etherboot/32 version.
Note that currently floppyload.bin requires at least an 80186/188 due to size
constraints. Contributions are welcome.
<P>
<P>
<P>Currently only booting tagged images (see documentation) is supported
as I don't know when or if Linux/ELKS will support booting off a NFS
mounted root. To make a tagged image see the directory netboot-*.
