<P>
<P>Etherboot is a package for creating ROM images that can download code
over the network to be executed on an x86 computer. Etherboot requires
the PC architecture, it does not work for other Linux platforms such as
Alphas or Suns. Typically the computer is diskless and the code is Linux
or FreeBSD, but these are not the only possibilities. The code uses the
bootp, tftp and NFS Internet Protocols.
<P>
<P>
<P>Etherboot is Open Source. Please support it by joining the Open Source
community and sharing. See the 
<A HREF="http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/">Etherboot home page</A> for some ways you can help
Etherboot.

<P><I>Disclaimer: Etherboot comes with NO warranties of any kind. It is
hoped that it will be useful to you, and NO responsibility is accepted
for any outcome of using it. Etherboot also comes with NO support,
although you can usually get helpful advice from the mailing lists
listed on the Etherboot home page.</I>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What hardware is supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The following is the current NIC configuration file as of 2000-11-29.
<P>Even if your NIC does not appear in the list, it may still be supported
if the chip is one of those supported.  Many OEMs use chips from
foundries. An exhaustive list of brand names is impossible.  The best
strategy is to read the number on the LAN controller chip on the board.

# This is the config file for creating Makefile rules for Etherboot ROMs
#
# To make a ROM for a supported NIC add a line of the form
#
# ROM           Driver-name     PCI-IDs
#
# ROM is the desired output name for both .rom and .lzrom images.
# Driver name is the driver it uses (can be omitted if the same as ROM).
# PCI IDs are the PCI vendor and device IDs of the PCI NIC
#   (leave blank for ISA NICs).
#
# All PCI ROMs that share a single driver are only built once (because they
# only have different PCI-IDs, but identical code).  ISA ROMS are built for
# each ROM type, because different vendors used a different logic around the
# basic chip.  The most popular example is the NS8390, which some cards use
# in PIO mode, some in DMA mode.  Two chips currently don't fit into this nice
# black-and-white scheme (the Lance and the NS8390).  Their driver deals
# with both PCI and ISA cards.  These drivers will be treated similarly to
# ISA only drivers by genrules.pl and are compiled for each ROM type that is
# ISA, and additionally compiled for the PCI card type.
#
# Then do: make clean, make Roms and make

<P>All Etherboot drivers are autoprobing, which means they attempt to detect
the hardware addresses at which the card is installed. It's fairly easy
to write a driver if you know C and are familiar with Ethernet hardware
interfacing. Please read the section on 
<A HREF="README-9.html#driver">Writing an Etherboot Driver</A> if you wish to do so.
