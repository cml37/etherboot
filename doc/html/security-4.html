<P>
<P>Password protected BOOT-Proms are  a considerable improvement over the
standard security measures  offered by the  PC architecture,  but they
are still vulnerable  to a variety  of attacks. Most of  these attacks
are related to the weaknesses of the BOOTP and TFTP protocol and these
issues are discussed in another section of text.
<P>
<P>
<P>As the BOOT-Prom cannot store the passwords locally, it has to request
them from the BOOTP/TFTP server.  The  BOOTP and TFTP protocols do not
allow for any elaborate  challenge/response authorization scheme. Thus
the BOOT-Prom  requests the password from  the server and subsequently
compares it   with the password   as  input by  the user.   As packets
transmitted on the ethernet can  easily be monitored, the server sends
a MD5 message  digest (as invented  by Ron  Rivest/"RSA Data Security,
Inc.")  of the actual password.  The  BOOT-Prom computes the MD5 value
for the user   input and compares  these two values.  It is  generally
believed that there is no way of  computing a valid  plain text from a
known   MD5 message digest,   other    than comparing it against   all
conceivable  input texts.   Thus, this  approach  is still  vulnerable
against  dictionary attacks. You should   aim for using long passwords
(although,  anything beyond 20  characters is unlikely to considerably
improve the security of  the  password) which are   not listed in  any
dictionary.   Make  sure that  these passwords  are memorized  and not
available in un-encrypted form. Replace the passwords regularly and do
not offer  more menu  entries in the   BOOTP data than are  absolutely
neccessary.
