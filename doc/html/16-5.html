<P>
<P>First of all get a bcc (Bruce Evan's C compiler) distribution, from the
ELKS tool distribution at http://www.cix.co.uk/&nbsp;mayday/ There is also a
mailing list for Linux-8086 developers at linux-8086 AT vger PERIOD
rutgers PERIOD edu. Send mail to majordomo AT vger PERIOD rutgers PERIOD
edu with the line "subscribe linux-8086" if you want to join. It's very
technical though and there won't be anything user friendly for a while.
<P>Look over the Config file to see if you need to alter something. By
default it builds images for all 4 versions. You can omit the ones
you don't want. But it compiles very quickly anyway.  Then build the
software by saying make. There will be some warnings about duplication
definitions of some library routines. Ignore them, the correct ones are
the ones in this directory.
