This tarball should be extracted inside the top directory of an
Etherboot distribution and will create a subdirectory called doc.  This
is so that the references to the files src/NIC and src/Config will work
when rebuilding the documentation.

All these files, except for the ones in maint are derived from the
masters in the sgml directory. So please edit those.

The documentation is also online at http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/.
You should consult that for the most up-to-date news.
