<p>

RFC1533 allows for vendor-specific extensions to the BOOTP
protocol. It defines that all tags in the range 128 thru 254 are set
aside for site-specific extensions. Common implementations of "bootpd"
daemons can assign arbitrary null-terminated character strings to
these tags.

<p>

This is a list of the tags that are currently used by the BOOT-Prom;
as a general rule, you should never fill out any of these entries,
unless you positively know that your BOOT-Prom supports the extension
or ignores this particular tag:

<p>

<descrip>

<tag/TAG 128/
        this is a six-byte hexadecimal entry. The first four bytes
        have to be the magic number E4 45 74 68; if this magic cannot
        be found, then none of the other vendor tags are valid! The
        fifth byte is the major version number and the sixth byte is
        the minor version number of this protocol extension. The
        current version is 0.0; the BOOT-Prom can assume that
        incompatible changes increase the major version number. Mere
        extensions to the existing protocol, increase the minor
        version number. If the BOOT-Prom code has been written in a
        way that anticipates future extensions, then it is acceptable
        to honor the vendor tags even though, the minor version number
        does not match exactly. Before making a change, that requires
        updating the major version number, you should contact all of
        the persons that are listed at the top of this document.

<tag/TAG 129/
        the BOOT-Prom uses this tag for passing a user-provided
        command line to the loaded operating system. As this tag is
        used internally, the "bootpd" daemon must not assign any value
        to it!

<tag/TAG 160/
        a string that contains a colon separated list of
        "parameter=value" pairs. Currently, these parameters are only
        used to control the behavior of an interactive menu for
        selecting different boot images; future extensions are quite
        likely:

	<descrip>
          <tag/timeout/after this many seconds, the default image will be
                    loaded. If no 'timeout' has been set, then the
                    program will wait indefinitely.
          <tag/default/either an integer 'n' in the range 0 thru 15 or
                    192 thru 207, selecting the default image. If 'n'
                    is in the first range, it refers to the 'n'th menu
                    entry; if it is in the later range, it refers to
                    the entry with the tag number 'n'. This
                    distinction is important, if the list of images
                    contains gaps. If no value has been set, then the
                    image with the lowest tag number will be the
                    default image.
	</descrip>

<tag/TAGS 161 thru 174/
        these tags are currently unused, but they should be allocated
        for purposes that resemble the function of tag 160.

<tag/TAG 175/
	the BOOT-Prom uses this tag for telling the DHCP server which
	NIC driver it is using. The DHCP server can then modify the
	"filename" field in the DHCPACK packet in order to direct the
	BOOT-Prom to download an appropriate kernel image.

<tag/TAG 176/
        the BOOT-Prom uses this tag for telling the loaded operating
        system, which of the entries in tags 192 to 207 has been
        selected by the user. As this tag is used internally, the
        "bootpd" daemon must not assign any value to it!

<tag/TAGS 177 thru 183/
        these tags are reserved for passing information from the
        BOOT-Prom to the boot image. Under no circumstances should the
        "bootpd" daemon assign any of these entries. The format of
        these parameters is yet to be discussed.

<tag/TAGS 184 thru 191/
        up to eight zero-terminated character strings can be used for
        displaying a "message of the day". If you need to display more
        than eight lines, you can embed suitable CR/LF pairs. If you
        fully exploit that feature, you can display a complete 80x24
        screen of information, but you should be aware that subsequent
        output might scroll part of a long message.

<p>

        The BOOT-Prom can optionally be configured to interpret some
        ANSI escape sequences. There also is an extension for
        including extra data via TFTP; this overcomes the size
        limitation of the tags 184-191.

<p>

        The ANSI emulation currently knows about these commands:

                              "col". They will  be drawn to  the right
                              of the last  graphics position.  No data
                              bytes follow.

                            x;y;rle;col
                              the next "rle"   pixels have  the  value
                              "col".  They will  be drawn  relative to
                              the top  left corner of the  text cursor
                              with an offset  of (x/y).  No data bytes
                              follow
                          you usually   do not  have   to enter  these
                          values manually, but you  should use  a tool
                          such as  "ppmtoansi" which  is  shipped with
                          your BOOT-Prom or available from the contrib
                          directory of the "etherboot" package.
            <esc>[a;b;c;d-<data>

                          bits. The first pixel is stored in the three
                          most  significant  bits  of the  first  data
                          byte.
</code>

        Note that you usually have to specify any control characters
        directly (rather than in hex form) in your bootptab file.

<tag/TAGS 192 thru 207/
        these tags define all of the valid boot images and override
        any settings that are given with the "bf" bootfile option in
        your "bootptab". It is allowed to leave gaps in the list.
        This has an impact on how the `default' image will be
        selected.

        All entries are of the form
<code>
            label:server:gateway:filename:passwd:flags:cmdline
</code>
        For future extensibility, it is permitted to append an
        arbitrary amount of other colon separated entries as long as
        the limit of 255 characters per tag is not exceeded.
        Non-existent entries can be left empty. This means that the
        default value for this particular entry will be used. Trailing
        colons can be omitted.

	<descrip>
          <tag/label/this is the text string that is displayed to the
                    user. It can contain arbitrary characters, except
                    for a colon. Embedding arbitrary control
                    characters is not recommended, but you might be
                    able to include ANSI escape sequences (if enabled
                    in the ROM) for changing text attributes as long
                    as you restore the attributes at the end of the
                    string. It probably does not make very much sense
                    to leave this entry empty.
          <tag/server/IP number of the TFTP server, where the image can
                    be found. This data has to be in decimal form
                    (e.g. 192.168.0.1); it is not permitted to use a
                    hostname. It is the responsibility of the "bootpd"
                    to look up hostnames. If this entry is omitted,
                    then the BOOTP server will be used for the TFTP
                    download.
          <tag/gateway/use this IP gateway, when accessing the boot image
                    by TFTP. If no value is given, the BOOTP gateway
                    or alternatively the first entry in the list of
                    gateways "gw" is used.
          <tag/filename/name of the boot image that has to be loaded by
                    TFTP. If this entry is omitted, then the machine
                    boots locally from disk. If enabled in the
                    BOOT-Prom, you can specify pseudo-filenames for
                    booting from a local blockdevice (floppy,
                    harddisk, ...); these filenames have to match the
                    pattern "/dev/[fh]d*". If the BOOT-Prom does not
                    have support for these pseudo-filenames, you can
                    still boot from blockdevices by storing an boot
                    image as generated by mknbi-blkdev under the name
                    of the desired blockdevice (symbolic links will
                    do). In Etherboot 4.6.2 and later, a - in this field
                    means use the filename specified in the BOOTP/DHCP reply.
                    This saves on menu size.
          <tag/passwd/MD5 message digest of the password. If this entry
                    is omitted, then no password is required for
                    loading this image. Support for passwords is
                    optional and might not be compiled into the ROM
                    image. For generating the MD5 message digest, you
                    can use freely available tools such as
                    "md5sum". C.f. the flags entry for controlling
                    the behavior of passwords.
          <tag/flags/flags are used for controlling some aspects of how
                    the BOOT-Prom code behaves. All flags are a string
                    of decimal digits followed by a letter; multiple
                    flags can be concatenated. If this entry is
                    omitted, then a default value of "1i1p" is
                    assumed. Currently, these flags are defined:

		<descrip>
                      <tag/0i/booting this image does not require a
                           password; the contents of the password
                           entry is ignored unless some other feature
                           (such as the flag "2p") requires it.
                      <tag/1i/booting this image requires a password. If
                           the password entry is omitted, or no
                           password support is available in the
                           BOOT-Prom, then this flag is ignored.
                      <tag/0p/the user cannot enter a command line for
                           passing parameters to the loaded image,
                           even if this feature has been enabled when
                           compiling the BOOT-Prom. N.B. this does not
                           affect the cmdline entry as described
                           below!
                      <tag/1p/the user does not get prompted for passing
                           parameters to the loaded image, but he can
                           explicitly request the prompt (e.g. by
                           pressing a modifier key while selecting an
                           image from the menu). If the password
                           entry is not omitted, then the password has
                           to be entered. Both parameter passing and
                           password validation can be disabled when
                           compiling the BOOT-Prom.
                      <tag/2p/the user always gets prompted for passing
                           parameters to the loaded image. If the
                           password entry is present and password
                           support has been enabled in the BOOT-Prom,
                           then the password has to be entered.
                      <tag/3p/the user always gets prompted for passing
                           parameters to the loaded image. No password
                           is required.
		</descrip>

          <tag/cmdline/the contents of this entry is appended to the end
                    of the command line that gets passed to the loaded
                    image. This feature is unaffected by the "p"
                    flags. Passing parameters currently does not make
                    sense for any operating system other than Linux
                    and is silently ignored for other operating
                    systems. As it is not legal to enter colons as
                    part of an entry, you have to escape them by
                    writing "&tilde;c" instead. This also means, that all
                    tilde characters have to be escaped by writing
                    "&tilde;&tilde;". As some bootp daemons do not allow for
                    entering a backslash in a character string, the
                    escape sequence "&tilde;b" inserts a backslash
                    character. Currently, all other escape sequences
                    are undefined.

For demonstration purposes, I attached an annotated excerpt from my
"bootptab" illustrating some of these techniques. In the following
the character sequence <tt/ESC/ should be replaced by the ASCII
escape character. Also the 8-bit characters have been changed to 7-bit
approximations due to SGML tool limitations. To get the original codes,
use this table: top left corner, char 201 (decimal); horizontal bar,
char 205; top right corner, char 187; vertical bar, char 186; bottom
left corner, char 200; bottom right corner, char 188.

# The MOTD (message of the day) can contain arbitrary characters, that
# the PC is capable of displaying.  Here we use 8bit characters for
# drawing a border around the message; also we change the foreground
# color to red (this assumes that the BOOT Prom has support for ANSI
# escape sequences):

# Alternatively, the MOTD can be stored in an external file; this
# requires that you enabled ANSI support in the BOOT Prom!  For more
# advanced configurability, you should explore the feature of the
# patched tftpd daemon (as available in the contrib directory) to
# execute shell scripts and use the output as the file contents.

#
# We use the "template" feature of modern versions of "bootp" in order
# to group common entries. Unfortunately, you cannot use more than one
# "tc" entry per (pseudo-) host.  Pseudo hostnames should begin with a
# leading period character.
#
# All entries are kept as generic as possible.  This ensures that they
# will keep working even when the network topology is changed. Leaving
# the server IP address and the gateway IP address empty, should
# ensure that booting works even when we go thru "bootpgw" gateways.
#
# "Technicolor" special effects are achieved by changing the
# foreground text color of the individual labels. You could even embed
# small icons after switching to graphics mode. C.f. "linux-logo.ansi"
# for an example; this will not work, if your BOOT Prom does not have
# support for ANSI escape sequences.
#
# Passing boot-time parameters to the Linux kernel, requires the
# password "Penguin".

# Booting from the local disk requires the password "Joshua". If the
# BOOT-Prom does not have support for booting from local block devices
# (floppy, harddrive, ...), then you can either omit the filename
# (c.f. README.Security for potential security problems) or your TFTP
# server has to provide a boot image that has been generated by
# mknbi-blkdev.

Here is an example DHCP specification illustrating the use of - in the
filename portion of the menu options to eliminate needless repetition.

<code>
    # per host setup
    host 192.168.40.203 {

        # MAC and IP addresses
        hardware ethernet  00:60:08:0d:a9:84;
        fixed-address 192.168.40.203;

        # default file to boot, common append options, default menu selection
and timeout
        filename "/tftpboot/thinlinux/1.0-alpha-025/3c59x-ide.ram0";
        option option-129 "ramdisk_size=16000 vga=6";
        option option-160 "timeout=10:default=192";
        option option-184 "^[['/tftpboot/thinlinux/1.0-alpha-025/motd'#";

        # menu selections, specify filename or "-" to use default filename
specified above
        option option-192 "test1:::-:::nfs=xterm";
        option option-193 "test2:::-:::nfs=shell";
        option option-194 "test3:::-:::nfs=other";
    }
</code>

<p>

For ISC DHCPD 3.0 Beta 2 Patchlevel 18 and above the syntax above is no
longer accepted and a new syntax is in operation according to this note
in the Changelog:

<code>
Use unparsable names for unknown options. WARNING: this will break any
configuration files that use the option-nnn convention. If you want to
continue to use this convention for some options, please be sure to
write a definition, like this:

option option-nnn code nnn = string;

You can use a descriptive name instead of option-nnn if you like.
</code>

<p>

If you only have old BOOT-Proms and want to use these advanced
features without having to burn new BOOT-Proms, there is a little
trick.

<p>

You may have noticed that old BOOT-Proms ignore all of these vendor
extensions and unconditionally load the file that is given in the "bf"
bootfile entry. On the other hand, new BOOT-Proms completely ignore
the "bf" entry when they find a list of images in the vendor extension
tags.

<p>

Therefore, you create a boot image that contains the new BOOT-Prom
code and specify the filename in the "bf" entry. This results in a two
step bootloading process. First the old BOOT-Prom loads the new code
and then the new code displays the message of the day, processes the
image list, asks the user for his preferred image (and possibly for
parameters and a password) and then proceeds booting.
