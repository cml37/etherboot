  Etherboot is a software package for creating ROM images that can
  download code over an Ethernet network to be executed on an x86
  computer. Many network adapters have a socket where a ROM chip can be
  installed.  Etherboot is code that can be put in such a ROM. Etherboot
  can also be booted from floppies (mainly for testing purposes but some
  people have been known to use this all the time) and hard disk, as a
  LILO/SYSLINUX compatible image, or from a hard disk partition.



  Etherboot requires the PC architecture, it does not work for other
  Linux platforms such as Alphas or Suns. Typically the computer is
  diskless and the code is Linux or FreeBSD, but these are not the only
  possibilities.  The code uses the bootp, tftp and NFS Internet
  Protocols, among others.



  For a somewhat out of date talk/tutorial type introduction to what
  Etherboot does and how to set it up, see my SLUG talk <diskless.html>.
  You may wish to review this before reading further.

  The following is the current NIC configuration file as of 2001-09-16.

  Even if your NIC does not appear in the list, it may still be
  supported if the chip is one of those supported.  Many OEMs use chips
  from foundries. An exhaustive list of brand names is impossible.  The
  best strategy is to read the number on the LAN controller chip on the
  board.




























  ______________________________________________________________________
  # This is the config file for creating Makefile rules for Etherboot ROMs
  #
  # To make a ROM for a supported NIC add a line of the form
  #
  # ROM           Driver-name     PCI-IDs
  #
  # ROM is the desired output name for both .rom and .lzrom images.
  # Driver name is the driver it uses (can be omitted if the same as ROM).
  # PCI IDs are the PCI vendor and device IDs of the PCI NIC
  #   (leave blank for ISA NICs).
  #
  # All PCI ROMs that share a single driver are only built once (because they
  # only have different PCI-IDs, but identical code).  ISA ROMS are built for
  # each ROM type, because different vendors used a different logic around the
  # basic chip.  The most popular example is the NS8390, which some cards use
  # in PIO mode, some in DMA mode.  Two chips currently don't fit into this nice
  # black-and-white scheme (the Lance and the NS8390).  Their driver deals
  # with both PCI and ISA cards.  These drivers will be treated similarly to
  # ISA only drivers by genrules.pl and are compiled for each ROM type that is
  # ISA, and additionally compiled for the PCI card type.
  #
  # Then do: make clean, make Roms and make
  #
  # Please send additions to this file to <ken_yap@users.sourceforge.net>
  #
  # 3c59x cards (Vortex) and 3c900 cards
  # If your 3c900 NIC detects but fails to work, e.g. no link light, with
  # the 3c905 driver, try using the 3c595 driver. I have one report that the
  # 3c595 driver handles these NICs properly. (The 595 driver uses the
  # programmed I/O mode of operation, whereas the 90x driver uses the bus
  # mastering mode. These NICs are capable of either mode.) When it comes to
  # making a ROM, as usual, you must choose the correct image, the one that
  # contains the same PCI IDs as your NIC.

  ______________________________________________________________________





  All Etherboot drivers are autoprobing, which means they attempt to
  detect the hardware addresses at which the card is installed. It's
  fairly easy to write a driver if you know C and are familiar with
  Ethernet hardware interfacing. Please read the developer manual
  <devman.html> if you wish to do so.

  Please join the Etherboot mailing lists
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/etherboot>. These are listed on the
  Etherboot home page. There is a users mailing list and a developers
  mailing list. The users list is for issues with building and running
  the software, while the developers list is for issues with features
  and coding.



  Please post questions to the Etherboot mailing lists instead of
  mailing me because: you get the benefit of a lot of experts seeing
  your question (no, I don't know everything, if only because there are
  many configurations I have never used); a lot of people see the
  question and answer and this helps them too.  You will usually not get
  any reply from me if you email questions to me directly. I want to
  make the best use of my time and that is by making sure that as many
  people as possible see the questions and answers. Note that I will
  post my replies to the mailing lists so to see the answers you should
  subscribe, or be willing to check the archives later.



  Other lists you can join are the Netboot mailing list (joining details
  on Etherboot home page), and the Linux Terminal Server Project mailing
  lists at LTSP <http://www.ltsp.org/>.  The Etherboot and Netboot lists
  are for general netbooting issues, while LTSP is focused more on the
  LTSP packages. However there is a fair amount of overlap between the
  lists and many key people are on all lists.



  Note that the Netboot mailing list is spam protected.  If your ISP has
  been slack security-wise and had a machine of theirs get onto one of
  the Open Relay Blacklists, then you will not be allowed to post. The
  only things I can suggest are to change your ISP to a more responsible
  one, or to get a Web based mailbox. I cannot help you with problems
  here as I do not administer the Netboot mailing list.

  Marty Connor has set up a web form <http://rom-o-matic.net/> for
  creating a ROM image on the fly and returning it as the output of the
  form. If all you want is a ROM image, this could save you time
  building the distribution.

  Unpack the distribution using gunzip and tar, using one of the
  following commands, where you replace x by the patchlevel number:




  ______________________________________________________________________
          tar zxvf etherboot-5.0.x.tar.gz
          tar jxvf etherboot-5.0.x.tar.bz2

          bunzip2 < etherboot-5.0.x.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
  ______________________________________________________________________



  If the documentation tarball was provided separately, then in addition
  do this:




  ______________________________________________________________________
          cd etherboot-5.0.x
  ______________________________________________________________________



  followed by one of the following:


  ______________________________________________________________________
          tar zxvf ../etherboot-doc-5.0.x.tar.gz
          tar jxvf ../etherboot-doc-5.0.x.tar.bz2

          bunzip2 < ../etherboot-doc-5.0.x.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -

  which will extract the documentation in a subdirectory of the
  Etherboot top directory.

  To build the ROM images you need a recent release of gcc and the
  binutils tools. This package has been compiled with the tools from a
  SuSE 7.1 distribution but it should work with any recent Linux or
  FreeBSD distribution. gas 2.9.1 is too old to handle the 16-bit code
  in loader.S. Use gas 2.9.5 at least. Also the "gcc 2.96" used in
  RedHat 7.0 (and later versions maybe) generates faulty machine code
  compiling Etherboot.  Use kgcc from those distributions instead.



  You only have to go to src/, edit the options in Config and say make.
  We suggest you accept the default options if you are not sure what to
  select.  This will create all the ROM images available in bin32. The
  .lzrom images are the same as the .rom images. Since the .lzrom images
  are smaller and work exactly the same, there is no real reason to use
  .rom images any more, unless you are nervous about compression
  algorithm patents. We believe the algorithm used does not infringe
  patents, having been in public use for some time, but we do not know
  all the legal ramifications. See here <COPYING_compressor.html> for
  more details.



  Here is a description of the options available:
















































  ______________________________________________________________________
  User interaction options:

  -DASK_BOOT=n
                  Ask "Boot from Network or from Local? " at startup,
                  timeout after n seconds (0 = no timeout); this
                  can be done in a more generic way by using the
                  IMAGE_MENU, but it requires that the "bootp"
                  server is accessible, even when booting locally.
                  If unset, boot immediately using the default.
  -DANS_DEFAULT=ANS_NETWORK
                  Assume Network to previous question
                  (alternative: ANS_LOCAL) on timeout or Return key
                  See etherboot.h for prompt and answer strings.
  -DBAR_PROGRESS
                  Use rotating bar instead of sequential dots
                  to indicate an IP packet transmitted.
  -DMOTD
                  Display message of the day; read vendortags.html
                  for further information.
  -DIMAGE_MENU
                  Allow to interactively chose between different
                  bootimages; read vendortags.html for further
                  information.
  -DPASSWD
                  Enable password protection for boot images; this
                  requires -DIMAGE_MENU.
  -DUSRPARMS
                  Allow the user to interactively edit parameters
                  that are passed to the booted kernel; you should
                  probably enable -DPASSWD as well; this feature
                  requires -DIMAGE_MENU.
  -DANSIESC
                  Evaluate a subset of common ANSI escape sequences
                  when displaying the message of the day; this
                  probably does not make sense unless you also
                  define -DMOTD or at least -DIMAGE_MENU. It is
                  possible to combine this option with -DCONSOLE_DUAL,
                  but you have to be aware that the boot menu will
                  no longer use ANSI escapes to be compatible with the
                  serial console. Also be careful with your banners, as
                  they may confuse your serial console. Generally you
                  lose most of the ANSIESC functionality..
  -DGFX
                  Support extensions to the ANSI escape sequences for
                  displaying graphics (icons or logos); this
                  requires -DANSIESC. It probably does not make sense
                  to use -DGFX if you have -DCONSOLE_DUAL, as the
                  serial console normally cannot handle the GFX stuff.
  -DSHOW_NUMERIC
                  Display menu item labels as numbers.
  -DDELIMITERLINES
                  Print a line of = characters at the start
                  and also just before starting an image.
  -DSIZEINDICATOR
                  Update a running total of the amount of code
                  loaded so far, in kilobytes.

  Boot autoconfiguration protocol options:

  -DNO_DHCP_SUPPORT
                  Use BOOTP instead of DHCP.
  -DRARP_NOT_BOOTP
                  Use RARP instead of BOOTP/DHCP.
  -DREQUIRE_VCI_ETHERBOOT
                  Require an encapsulated Vendor Class Identifier
                  of "Etherboot" in the DHCP reply
                  Requires DHCP support.

  Boot tuning parameters:

  -DCONGESTED
                  Turns on packet retransmission.  Use it on a
                  congested network, where the normal operation
                  can't boot the image.
  -DBACKOFF_LIMIT
                  Sets the maximum RFC951 backoff exponent to n.
                  Do not set this unreasonably low, because on networks
                  with many machines they can saturate the link
                  (the delay corresponding to the exponent is a random
                  time in the range 0..3.5*2^n seconds).  Use 5 for a
                  VERY small network (max. 2 minutes delay), 7 for a
                  medium sized network (max. 7.5 minutes delay) or 10
                  for a really huge network with many clients, frequent
                  congestions (max. 1  hour delay).  On average the
                  delay time will be half the maximum value.  If in
                  doubt about the consequences, use a larger value.
                  Also keep in mind that the number of retransmissions
                  is not changed by this setting, so the default of 20
                  may no longer be appropriate.  You might need to set
                  MAX_ARP_RETRIES, MAX_BOOTP_RETRIES, MAX_TFTP_RETRIES
                  and MAX_RPC_RETRIES to a larger value.

  Boot device options:

  -DCAN_BOOT_DISK
                  Can boot from floppy/hd if bootimage matches the
                  pattern "/dev/[fhs]d*".
  -DTRY_FLOPPY_FIRST
                  If > 0, tries that many times to read the boot
                  sector from a floppy drive before booting from
                  ROM. If successful, does a local boot.
                  It assumes the floppy is bootable.
                  Requires -DCAN_BOOT_DISK.
  -DEMERGENCYDISKBOOT
                  If no BOOTP server can be found, then boot from
                  local disk. The accessibility of the TFTP server
                  has no effect, though! So configure your BOOTP
                  server properly. You should probably reduce
                  MAX_BOOTP_RETRIES to a small number like 3.

  Boot image options:

  -DTAGGED_IMAGE
                  Add tagged image kernel boot support (recommended).
  -DAOUT_IMAGE
                  Add a.out kernel boot support (generic).
  -DELF_IMAGE
                  Add generic ELF kernel boot support (recommended).
  -DIMAGE_MULTIBOOT
                  Add Multiboot image support (currently only
                  for ELF images).
                  Without this, generic ELF support is selected.
  -DIMAGE_FREEBSD
                  Add FreeBSD image loading support (requires at least
                  -DAOUT_IMAGE and/or -DELF_IMAGE).
  -DFREEBSD_KERNEL_ENV
                  Pass in FreeBSD kernel environment
  -DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTP
                  If defined, boots by TFTP (recommended).
  -DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_NFS
                  If defined, boots from a NFS mount and disables
                  TFTP loading. Default is DOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTP
                  if neither is defined.

  Console options:

  -DCONSOLE_CRT
                  Set for CRT console (default if nothing else is set).
  -DCONSOLE_SERIAL
                  Set for serial console.
  -DCONSOLE_DUAL
                  Set for CRT and serial console, see comment at
                  -DANSIESC and -DGFX.
  -DCOMCONSOLE
                  Set port, e.g. 0x3F8.
  -DCONSPEED
                  Set speed, e.g. 57600.
  -DCOMPARM
                  Set Line Control Register value for data bits, stop
                  bits and parity. See a National Semiconditor 8250/
                  16450/16550 data sheet for bit meanings.
                  If undefined, defaults to 0x03 = 8N1.

  BIOS interface options:

  -DPNP_BUT_NOT_BBS_COMPLIANT
                  Some BIOSes claim to be PNP but they don't conform
                  to the BBS spec which specifies that ES:DI must
                  point to the string $PnP on entry. This option
                  works around those.
  -DNO_DELAYED_INT
                  Take control as soon as BIOS detects the ROM.
                  Normally hooks onto INT18H or INT19H. Use only if you
                  have a very non-conformant BIOS as it bypasses
                  BIOS initialisation of devices. This only works for
                  legacy ROMs, i.e. PCI_PNP_HEADER not defined.
                  This option was formerly called NOINT19H.
  -DBOOT_INT18H
                  Etherboot normally hooks onto INT19H for legacy ROMs.
                  You can choose to hook onto INT18H (BASIC interpreter
                  entry point) instead. This entry point is used when
                  all boot devices have been exhausted.
  -DCONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
                  Define this for PCI BIOSes that do not implement
                  BIOS32 or not correctly. Normally not needed.
                  Only works for BIOSes of a certain era.
  -DCONFIG_TSC_CURRTICKS
                  Uses the processor time stamp counter instead of reading
                  the BIOS time counter.  This allows Etherboot to work
                  even without a BIOS.  This only works on late model
                  486s and above.

  Obscure options you probably don't need to touch:

  -DPOWERSAVE
                  Halt the processor when waiting for keyboard input
                  which saves power while waiting for user interaction.
                  Good for compute clusters and VMware emulation.
                  But may not work for all CPUs.
  -DT503_AUI
                  Use AUI by default on 3c503 cards.
  -DMOVEROM
                  If your motherboard does not cache adapter memory
                  space, then this option can speed up loading of
                  compressed BOOT-Prom images. It has no effect on
                  uncompressed images. Unless you are very tight on
                  free space, you will usually want to define this
                  option.  This flag must be added to LCONFIG!
                  (recommended).
  -DUSE_LOWMEM_BUFFER
                  Define to put some buffers below 0x10000 which
                  may interfere with other programs (not recommended).

  You may have to set the PCI vendor and device IDs correctly for PCI
  NICs. Look at the file NIC. Locate the line that has the correct PCI
  IDs for your NIC. This will give you the name of the ROM image you
  should use.  The PCI IDs are usually displayed by the BIOS on booting
  up. They can also be read out from a running Linux system using the
  Linux PCI Utilities
  <http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mj/pciutils.html>.  If you do not
  use the ROM with the correct IDs, the floppy version will work, but
  the ROM will not since the BIOS will check for a match.


  33..55..  TTeessttiinngg tthhee RROOMM iimmaaggeess


  You can test the image with a floppy before programming an EPROM. On
  Linux just put a blank floppy in fd0 and say make bin32/card.fd0 where
  card is the name of your network card and it will copy a bootable
  image onto the floppy. If you wish to do this by hand, it's easy, just
  make bin/boot1a.bin and prepend this to card.rom (or card.lzrom) and
  write this combined binary to the floppy raw, i.e. starting at the
  boot block.  Like this, after you have done a make to create all the
  images:




  ______________________________________________________________________
          cat bin/boot1a.bin bin32/3c509.lzrom > /dev/fd0
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Make sure the floppy has no bad blocks. It is best if it has been
  formatted just before use. You do not need to put any kind of
  filesystem on it. If you wish, you could substitute /dev/fd0 with the
  actual device suitable for the floppy size you are using, for example
  /dev/fd0H1440 for 1.44 MB floppies. This may be more reliable than
  using the autodetecting device /dev/fd0.



  This will also work on a hard disk partition, but as this is a riskier
  operation, you should read the instructions in boot1a.s. If you don't
  understand how to do it, please ask the mailing list for help, don't
  just try it and destroy your disk data.



  When you boot with this floppy it will load the Etherboot ROM image
  from floppy and execute it. If you chose the correct ROM image, it
  should be able to detect your card. To get the bootrom to acquire an
  IP address and load the intended code, you need to set up bootp or
  DHCP, tftp and NFS services, which we will discuss next.
  We suggest you continue to use floppy booting until you have completed
  the setup of the server and are satisfied that diskless booting works.



  In addition, you can generate images with the suffixes .com, .lilo,
  .lzlilo and .pxe. Where you would normally say:


  ______________________________________________________________________
          make bin32/3c509.rom
  ______________________________________________________________________



  you would say


  ______________________________________________________________________
          make bin32/3c509.com
  ______________________________________________________________________



  and similarly for .lilo, .lzlilo and .pxe. These are alternate boot
  image formats.



  The ones ending in .com are DOS format executables, suitable for
  starting from DOS. It requires a real DOS environment, not a virtual
  DOS environment such as that provided by the DOS prompt window under
  Windows. Also it requires that there be no XMS drivers or other memory
  handlers loaded. It is not guaranteed to work if the environment is
  not clean, and sometimes not even if it is. The best chance of this
  format working is when DOS is booted with no device drivers
  whatsoever.  If you can, use raw floppy or SYSLINUX booting instead.



  The ones ending in .lilo and .lzlilo look sufficiently like Linux
  kernel images to be accepted by LILO and SYSLINUX for installation.
  Unfortunately loadlin uses a slightly different method of booting for
  Linux kernels from LILO and SYSLINUX and will not work with these
  images. The difference between .lilo and .lzlilo is compression,
  analogous to the difference between .rom and .lzrom.



  The fact that .(lz)lilo images look like a Linux kernel to LILO and
  SYSLINUX allows some interesting booting possibilities. For example,
  you could use LILO to select between DOS/Windows and Etherboot images
  from a disk that contains no Linux partitions, only FAT based
  partitions. This HOWTO <lilo+etherboot.html> shows you how this can be
  arranged.



  The ones ending in .pxe can be booted by a PXE booter. This is useful
  to chain to Etherboot from PXE. Here
  <http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/5299/125/6129709/> are
  some notes on how to combine PXE and Etherboot.




  In addition you can generate .dsk and .lzdsk images. These are just
  the .rom or .lzrom with the disk loader already prepended, and the
  size padded out to 18 kB, for reasons of filling out a floppy track.
  The make command is similar to those above.

  In this section I assume you want to boot a Linux kernel. Booting a
  FreeBSD kernel is documented elsewhere and does not require a tagged
  image.  Booting a DOS kernel is similar, the main differences being in
  the way you set up the tagged image.


  44..11..  MMaakkiinngg aa ttaaggggeedd iimmaaggee


  Etherboot expects to download a tagged image <spec.html> containing
  the code to be executed. Briefly explained, a tagged image is a
  wrapper around the pieces of code or data that need to be put in
  various places in the computer's memory. It contains a directory
  telling how large the pieces are and where they go in memory. It also
  says where to start execution.



  A tagged image is created using a utility program. The utility program
  <mknbi.html> is specific to the kernel you want to load. The version
  for Linux is called mknbi-linux or mkelf-linux and that for DOS is
  mknbi-dos. These utilities are distributed separately and can be
  obtained from Etherboot web site
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/etherboot/>.

  You will almost certainly have to compile a custom kernel because the
  kernel needs to have the "Root file system on NFS" option compiled in.
  (You need to select "NFS filesystem support" as built-in, not a
  module, and possibly also "Kernel level autoconfiguration" before this
  option will appear.)  You should also select "BOOTP support" and/or
  "DHCP support".  "RARP support" is not needed.  In 2.2 kernels you
  have to enable the "Kernel level autoconfiguration" option under IP
  networking to access the BOOTP support question.  And unless you are
  using an initrd (initial ramdisk) you will have to compile in the
  driver for your network card too. For details, see the file
  /usr/src/linux/Documentation/nfsroot.txt in a Linux kernel source
  distribution.



  After you have compiled the custom kernel, make the tagged image,
  typically like this:


  ______________________________________________________________________
          mknbi-linux --output=/tftpdir/vmlinuz.xterm zImage
  ______________________________________________________________________



  (See an important note regarding IP autoconfig in kernels in the 2.2
  series 2.2.18 and after under the section --ip= in the mknbi-linux
  documentation <mknbi.html>.)  Then put the tagged image in where the
  tftp daemon expects to find it, in this example /tftpdir. Make sure it
  is world-readable because typically the tftp daemon runs as an
  unprivileged user. It is recommended that you set a path explicitly
  for tftpd instead of relying on any defaults. For example:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  tftp    dgram   udp     wait    root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.tftpd /tftpdir
  ______________________________________________________________________




  44..33..  SSeettttiinngg uupp aa DDHHCCPP ddaaeemmoonn


  You need to set up a DHCP server to hand out an IP address and other
  configuration information to the client.



  Here is a sample DHCP configuration for ISC dhcpd:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  option domain-name "ken.net.au";
  option domain-name-servers 192.168.26.1;
  option broadcast-address 192.168.26.255;
  use-host-decl-names on;
  subnet 192.168.26.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
          filename "/tftpdir/vmlinuz.xterm";
          host xterm {
                  hardware ethernet 08:00:2B:B7:F3:80;
                  fixed-address xterm.ken.net.au;
                  filename "/tftpdir/vmlinuz.xterm";
          }
  }
  ______________________________________________________________________



  The declaration "use-host-decl-names on" tells dhcpd to include the
  name xterm in the reply so that it can be used as part of pathname to
  mount by NFS, etc.



  If your tftp server is not the same as the DHCP server, use the next-
  server declaration to specify a tftp server.



  You don't have to use fixed addresses, of course, but if you use
  dynamic addresses, then you have to deal with the resulting issues of
  NFS mounting.



  Recent kernels in the 2.2 series can autoconfigure using DHCP thanks
  to code by Chip Salzenberg. It also can use DHCP in 2.4 kernels
  starting from 2.4.4 thanks to Eric Biederman.  Otherwise the kernel
  will do a bootp request to find the IP address for mounting the NFS
  filesystem.



  You may also wish to investigate the --rootdir=rom option in mknbi-
  linux <mknbi.html> which tells the kernel to take the address from the
  initial DHCP reply, or to use initrds in conjunction with a userland
  DHCP client program to configure the netbooted machine.



  Not all DHCP servers can be configured to hand out all the information
  needed. In particular, it is rumoured that some Windows based DHCP
  servers do not have any means of specifying the boot file. The problem
  with using Etherboot in such an environment is that if you install
  your own DHCP server, it may interfere with Windows clients. Etherboot
  has a feature designed to overcome this problem. It consists of two
  parts:



  The first part is Etherboot contains code that when it sends out a
  DHCPDISCOVER request, a tag containing a Vendor Class Identifier of
  "Etherboot-x.y" is sent out, where x.y is the version number,
  currently 5.0. The 5 and the 0 are printable digits, not binary
  values, i.e. byte values 53 and 48 respectively. This allows the
  server to identify Etherboot clients and ignore all others.



  The second part is Etherboot can be conditionally compiled to require
  a Vendor Encapsulated Option containing a VCI of "Etherboot",
  otherwise it will ignore the DHCPOFFER. The option is not compiled in
  by default because it would cause Etherboot to not boot in plain
  setups.  The server we want to respond will include this tag in
  DHCPOFFERs and while other servers (e.g. Windows servers) may respond,
  they will be ignored.



  Vendor Encapsulated Option is supported in ISC DHCPD 2 or 3.  (It's
  not documented in DHCPD 2, but it works.) Other DHCP servers may
  support VEO. (It's a RFC2132 option.) In ISC DHCPD 3, follow the
  documentation for declaring a VEO scope. In ISC DHCPD 2 the magic line
  required is:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  option vendor-encapsulated-options 3c:09:45:74:68:65:72:62:6f:6f:74:ff;
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Put this in the appropriate scope.  Translation: Vendor Encapsulation
  Options (Option 43) encloses: Vendor Class Identifier (Option 60 =
  0x3c), length 9, value "Etherboot"; End of Options (Option 255 =
  0xff).



  If you have a DHCP server already running for the subnet, you probably
  should specify that your additional ISC DHCPD server is non
  authoritative for the the subnet, or it will veto (NAK) existing
  client IP address allocations, upsetting the status quo. See the ISC
  DHCPD options documentation.



  More information about DHCP can be found at the DHCP FAQ Web Page
  <http://web.syr.edu/~jmwobus/comfaqs/dhcp.faq.html>.
  If you are on a local network that is not directly connected to the
  Internet, you can use the "private" IP addresses 192.168.x.y (or in
  the other ranges mentioned in RFC1918
  <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt>). Otherwise please ask either
  your network administrator or your Internet service provider for your
  own IP address(es).

  You could use a bootp daemon instead of a DHCP daemon. This means
  installing the bootp package, sometimes it's not supplied or installed
  by default in some distributions.  Then you need to make sure that the
  bootps service is active in /etc/inetd.conf; it should look something
  like this:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  bootps  dgram   udp     wait    root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  bootpd
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Then you need to edit /etc/bootptab. The essential pieces of
  information you need to put in bootptab are:


  1. The domain name of the machine.

  2. The Ethernet (MAC) address of the network card, which you generally
     obtain from a sticker on the card, a configuration program for the
     card, or in the last resort, from watching the output of Etherboot
     or from the packets sent from the card when trying to boot, using
     the debug option of bootpd.

  3. The name of the tagged image file, relative to the tftpdir
     directory.

  4. The IP address you intend to give it.

  5. The IP addresses of various servers. You will need at least the
     tftp server's address.



  Here is an example of a /etc/bootptab for the bootpd supplied with
  many Linux distributions and probably many versions of Unix:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  .default:\
          :ht=ethernet:\
          :hd=/tftpdir:bf=null:\
          :ds=nameserver:\
          :hn:to=36000:
  xterm.ken.net.au:tc=.default:ha=08002BB7F380:ip=192.168.26.100:bf=vmlinuz.xterm
  ______________________________________________________________________



  The first entry sets up some common defaults which applies to all
  succeeding entries which can be "included" using the tc=.default
  attribute. The first field is the domain name of the machine. The ha
  attribute is the Ethernet address.  The ip attribute is self-
  explanatory. The bf field specifies the tagged image filename. For
  more details, consult the bootptab man page.



  Please note that if you use the ef (extension file) attribute to be
  able to send more configuration data to the diskless machine, you must
  run bootpef everytime bootptab is modified.


  44..55..  SSeettttiinngg uupp aa ttffttpp ddaaeemmoonn


  Now set up a tftp daemon. This means installing the tftp package and
  making sure that the tftp service is active in /etc/inetd.conf. If you
  want to be very careful you may wish to use the secure (-s) option of
  tftpd, this chroots to the specified directory, but then your
  pathnames in bootptab or dhcpd.conf must be relative to the new root
  directory.



  If you are booting many clients you should be aware of the limitations
  of running tftpd from inetd. Typically inetd has limits on how often a
  daemon can be spawned, to detect runaway daemons. If many clients
  request the tftp service within a short period, inetd may shutdown
  that service.  If you have a setup where there are many clients, it
  may be better to use an improved replacement for inetd, such as
  xinetd.  Another solution is to run a dedicated tftpd that is not
  spawned from inetd. One such tftpd can be found here at:
  ftp://nilo.on.openprojects.net/pub/nilo/snapshots Another possible
  contender is in the directory atftp at the Etherboot web site. This
  one is started from inetd, but thereafter multithreads internally.


  55..  TTeessttiinngg tthhee nneettwwoorrkk bboooottiinngg


  Now when you start up Etherboot, it should obtain an IP address and
  print out what it received. If you do not get this to work, turn on
  debugging in bootpd and see if any query was received. You may also
  wish to use the tcpdump or ethereal utilities to watch the network for
  bootp packets (port bootps).  If not, check your network hardware
  (cables, etc). If a query was received, check if bootpd/dhcpd was able
  to give an answer. If not, then the Ethernet address was not found in
  /etc/bootptab or /etc/dhcp.conf. If a reply was sent, then only faulty
  hardware or a bug in Etherboot would prevent it being received by
  Etherboot.



  Assuming an IP address was received, the next thing Etherboot tries to
  do is load a file using tftp. Check your system logs to see if a tftp
  daemon was started up and a file requested. Generally if you run tftpd
  under tcpwrapper security, a log entry will be generated. If not, it
  could be a path problem or file permission problem (the file needs to
  be readable by tftpd). Another problem could be that tftpd needs to
  reverse map the IP address to a name for security checking, and you
  don't have the client's details in /etc/hosts or in DNS, or your
  tcpwrapper config files (/etc/hosts.deny, /etc/hosts/allow) do not
  allow the access. Fix the problem.



  After the tagged image is loaded, Etherboot will jump to it. If it
  crashes here, check that the image is a tagged image. If it executes
  and stops at the point where it's trying to mount the NFS root, then
  you need to check that you have the "root on NFS" option compiled in
  and that you have compiled in the network card driver.


  55..11..  SSeettttiinngg uupp aa NNFFSS rroooott ffiilleessyysstteemm


  Now you need to set up a NFS root filesystem for the diskless
  computer.  Typically this is under /tftpboot/<ip address of computer>.
  In 2.1 and higher kernels, this should be /tftpboot/<name of computer
  in bootptab>.  This needs to contain a complete root filesystem that
  will make the kernel boot happily.  This means, for most kernels, it
  should contain /dev, /proc, /etc, /sbin, /bin, /tmp and /var. The
  details vary from distribution to distribution.  Once you have got the
  initial filesystem mounted, you can mount additional network
  filesystems such as /usr or /opt to give you a full execution
  environment.



  See the FAQ section for various methods of constructing a NFS root
  filesystem. There is no one true method. In the method I use I was
  lazy so I just make a copy of the necessary files from an existing
  Linux filesystem on the server and modify some key files
  appropriately. You can find a description in my tutorial
  <diskless.html> and some shell scripts to copy the files. Since the
  amount of disk space needed is relatively small in these days of large
  disks, I don't bother to throw out things that may not be needed.



  One thing to be aware of is that when you host the root filesystem on
  a NFS server that is not Linux, the major and minor numbers of device
  files will be different from what Linux is expecting, so the init
  process will probably break just after it mounts the root NFS, maybe
  when it tries to open the console device. You must create the root
  filesystem so that it is Linux compatible, even though it is hosted on
  a different Unix.  One way might be to use cpio to capture a Linux
  root FS and then to unpack on the target Unix system.



  Warning: Do not attempt to reuse the root filesystem of your server,
  whether by exporting it directly or by making hard links (symbolic
  links will not work). First of all, the configuration files will
  contain information pertaining to the server, not the client, so your
  client will get the wrong information. Secondly, this is a security
  risk. NFS is already not totally safe, but this way you are directly
  exposing your server root to clients. Even if you make hard links, the
  clients could (maliciously or accidentally) overwrite key binaries,
  making the server unusable. Don't try to save a few megabytes of disk
  space this way. You can however share some directories between
  clients, typically /sbin, /bin and /lib.  The sample scripts in the
  tutorial show you how.



  The root filesystem should be exported rw and no_root_squash because
  the various processes need to be root and need to write to log files
  in the root partition. You may wish to export /usr and /home
  filesystems to the diskless computer also. These do not need
  no_root_squash permission, and in the case of /usr probably only needs
  to be ro. Otherwise you will be opening up a security hole for hacking
  the server from the client. Be aware that practically all Linux
  distributions have a few "bugs" relating to symlinks and so forth for
  diskless booting.  These are mentioned in the tutorial.
  55..22..  IInniittiiaall rraammddiisskk


  It is possible to use initial ramdisk (initrd) in addition to, or in
  place of an NFS root. See the ramdisk argument of mknbi-linux
  <mknbi.html>. You will also need to read the Linux kernel
  documentation to see what extra arguments should be passed to the
  kernel to make it use an initrd, and how to arrange the initrd so that
  the startup script within it is called when it's mounted.



  Initrds are useful for loading modules before the NFS root is mounted,
  or to use some other network filesystem instead of NFS root, for
  example.  Some applications could even run totally out of initrd, e.g.
  Floppy Firewall <http://www.zelow.no/floppyfw/>, provided you have the
  memory, of course. Also postings on the kernel mailing lists indicate
  that at some point in the future, kernel level autoconfiguration
  (BOOTP/DHCP from the kernel) may be removed from the Linux kernel and
  initrds may be the way to start up a diskless system that can acquire
  an identity using a userland DHCP client program.

  This tutorial does not cover all possible ways of setting up a
  diskless client's initial filesystem. The NFS root method and the
  initrd method described above are two ways. You could even mount a
  conventional hard disk.  Why would you want to boot "diskless" if you
  have a hard disk?  Reasons might be: you do not wish to adminster the
  local disk; you want the assurance that a system is running a kernel
  from a central server; or you like the speed of network booting.
  Network booting is one technique in a toolbox. Techniques can be
  combined to do what you want.  If you are interested in running the
  diskless client as an X-terminal, a very common use, you may wish to
  investigate the Linux Terminal Server Project <http://www.ltsp.org/>.

  Swap over NFS can be arranged but you have to patch the kernel source.
  See here <http://www.instmath.rwth-aachen.de/~heine/nfs-swap/>.



  Be aware that opinions are divided on NFS swap.  Some people think
  it's a bad thing because it just kills the network if you have lots of
  diskless computers and that you shouldn't be running into a swap
  regime on a diskless computer anyway. Some other people like having a
  bit of insurance.



  Also have a look at the NBD
  <http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/nbd/nbd.html> Network Block
  Device web page for swapping over that. This requires a 2.1 or 2.2
  kernel.



  There is also the follow-on project ENBD
  <http://www.it.uc3m.es/~ptb/nbd/>, the Enhanced Network Block Driver.
  I have no experience with this for swapping. Comments welcome.

  What about DOS? The deal with DOS is that one is loading a virtual
  floppy called A: into extended memory and then booting from this
  floppy.  So you have to capture an image of a bootable DOS floppy
  first.  Some more details can be found in the mknbi-dos <mknbi.html>
  utility.



  I have booted DOS (both M$ versions up to 5.0 and DR versions up to
  7.03) diskless this way.  A mknbi-fdos <mknbi.html> is available for
  building tagged images for booting FreeDOS, the procedure differs
  slightly from booting M$ or DR DOS.



  If you were thinking of booting a Windows machine via the network, it
  seems (I'm not masochistic enough to do this) the problem is not the
  network booting but the mounting of a file system over NetBIOS
  (Windows does not do remote mounts of root filesystems over NetBIOS on
  TCP). So that rules out a Samba server. It appears to be possible over
  a Netware server, for which Linux or FreeBSD has workalikes. Also it
  is said that only certain versions of Windows will allow diskless
  booting.  You will also have problems with pathnames and the usual
  Windows hassles. Do you really want to do this?  You do know that you
  can run lots of desktop applications like Netscape, StarOffice, etc.
  on Linux, FreeBSD, etc.  now? Why pay good money when you can use
  equally good free replacements?  Anyway if you are still determined,
  in the Etherboot home page <http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/>, there
  are links to external Web pages, one explaining how this was done with
  a commercial TCP/IP boot ROM, another explaining how to do it using
  Etherboot and Netbios over IPX. Good luck and send us your experiences
  or better still a URL to a page explaining how you did it.

  Assuming you have satisfactorily set up your server environment, you
  may now wish to put the Etherboot onto an EPROM or EEPROM. Naturally
  this assumes access to hardware to program (and possibly erase)
  EPROMs.  Access to a friendly electronics engineer and/or lab is one
  way to program and erase EPROMs. Otherwise you can look at the
  commercial links page
  <http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/commercial.html> for places you can
  buy programmed EPROMs from.



  If you are familiar with electronics construction, an alternative is
  to use an EEPROM card. There is a schematic and PCB artwork for such a
  card at the web site where you got the Etherboot distribution. This
  EEPROM card plugs onto the ISA bus and can be reprogrammed with
  software.



  Some high-end network cards, for example the 3Com 905B, have a socket
  for an EEPROM which can be programmed in situ with the right
  utilities.  See any release notes accompanying Etherboot for more
  information.



  77..11..  CChhoooossiinngg tthhee EEPPRROOMM


  Most network cards come with a blank (E)EPROM socket even though it is
  seldom used. When it is used, it is typically filled with a
  proprietary EPROM from the network card manufacturer. You can put an
  Etherboot EPROM there instead.


  77..22..  EEnnaabblliinngg tthhee EEPPRROOMM


  First you must discover how to enable the EPROM socket on your card.
  Typically the EPROM is not enabled from the factory and a jumper or a
  software configuration program is used to enable it.


  77..33..  SSiizzee aanndd ssppeeeedd ooff tthhee EEPPRROOMM


  Secondly, you must discover what size and speed of EPROM is needed.
  This can be difficult as network card manufacturers often neglect to
  provide this information.



  The smallest EPROM that is accepted by network cards is an 8k EPROM
  (2764). 16kB (27128) or 32kB (27256) are the norm. Some cards will
  even go up to 64kB EPROMs (27512). (You will often see a C after the
  27, e.g.  27C256. This indicates a CMOS EPROM, which is equivalent to
  the non-C version and is a good thing because of lower power
  consumption.) You want to use the smallest EPROM you can so that you
  don't take up more of the upper memory area than needed as other
  extensions BIOSes may need the space.  However you also want to get a
  good price for the EPROM.  Currently the 32kB and 64kB EPROMs (27256
  and 27512) seem to be the cheapest per unit. Smaller EPROMs appear to
  be more expensive because they are out of mainstream production.



  If you cannot find out from the documentation what capacity of EPROM
  your card takes, for ISA NICs only, you could do it by trial and
  error. (PCI NICs do not enable the EPROM until the BIOS tells the NIC
  to.)  Take a ROM with some data on it (say a character generator ROM)
  and plug it into the socket. Be careful not to use an extension BIOS
  for this test because it may be detected and activated and prevent you
  from booting your computer.  Using the debug program under DOS, dump
  various regions of the memory space. Say you discover that you can see
  the data in a memory window from CC00:0 to CC00:3FFF (= 4000 hex =
  16384 decimal locations). This indicates that a 16kB EPROM is needed.
  However if you see an alias in parts of the memory space, say the
  region from CC00:0 to CC00:1FFF is duplicated in CC00:2000 to
  CC00:3FFF, then you have put an 8kB EPROM into a 16kB slot and you
  need to try a larger EPROM.



  Note that because pinouts for 28 pin EPROMs are upward compatible
  after a fashion, you can probably use a larger capacity EPROM in a
  slot intended for a smaller one. The higher address lines will
  probably be held high so you will need to program the image in the
  upper half or upper quarter of the larger EPROM, as the case may be.
  However you should double check the voltages on the pins armed with
  data sheet and a meter because CMOS EPROMs don't like floating pins.


  If the ROM is larger than the size of the image, for example, a 32 kB
  ROM containing a 16 kB image, then you can put the image in either
  half of the ROM. You will sometimes see advice to put two copies of
  the image in the ROM. This will work but is not recommended because
  the ROM will be activated twice if it's a legacy ROM and may not work
  at all if it's a PCI/PnP ROM.  It is tolerated by Etherboot because
  the code checks to see if it's been activated already and the second
  activation will do nothing. The recommended method is to fill the
  unused half with blank data.  All ones data is recommended because it
  is the natural state of the EPROM and involves less work for the PROM
  programmer. Here is a Unix command line that will generate 16384 bytes
  of 0xFF and combine it with a 16 kB ROM into a 32 kB image for your
  PROM programmer.

  The speed of the EPROM needed depends on how it is connected to the
  computer bus.  If the EPROM is directly connected to the computer bus,
  as in the case of many cheap NE2000 clones, then you will probably
  have to get an EPROM that is at least as fast as the ROMs used for the
  main BIOS. This is typically 120-150 ns. Some network cards mediate
  access to the EPROM via circuitry and this may insert wait states so
  that slower EPROMs can be used. Incidentally the slowness of the EPROM
  doesn't affect Etherboot execution speed much because Etherboot copies
  itself to RAM before executing. I'm told Netboot does the same thing.



  If you have your own EPROM programming hardware, there is a nice
  collection of EPROM file format conversion utilities here
  <http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/srecord.html>. The files
  produced by the Etherboot build process are plain binary. A simple
  binary to Intel hex format converter can be found at the Etherboot web
  site here <http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/bin2intelhex.c>.



  Etherboot is believed to make PnP compliant ROMs for PCI NICs. A long-
  standing bug in the headers has been tracked down. However some faulty
  old BIOSes are out there so I have written a Perl script swapdevids.pl
  to switch the header around if necessary. You'll have to experiment
  with it both ways to find out which works. Or you could dump a ROM
  image that works (e.g. RPL, PXE ROM) using the Perl script disrom.pl.
  The fields to look at are Device (base, sub, interface) Type.  It
  should be 02 00 00, but some BIOSes want 00 00 02 due to ambiguity in
  the original specification.

  +o  Floppy boot doesn't work. Is the floppy error-free? Have you copied
     the ROM image (with the disk loader prepended) to the floppy raw?
     Is that size of floppy bootable by your computer? Are you trying to
     run Etherboot on a 16 bit machine (286, 086/088)? Have you selected
     too many compile time options? The real limit on Etherboot is not
     the size of the EPROM but the fact that it executes in the 48kB
     region between 0x94000 and 0xA0000. If the sum of code, stack and
     bss is greater than 48kB, then Etherboot might crash at unexpected
     places.

  +o  Floppy version works but EPROM version doesn't work. There is a
     program called rom-scan (Linux, FreeBSD and DOS versions) in the
     directory contrib/rom-scan which will help detect problems. Rom-
     scan will only work on ISA ROMs though.


  +o  If the EPROM is not detected at all then the contents of the EPROM
     are not visible to the BIOS. Check that you have enabled the EPROM
     with any jumpers or soft configuration settings. Check that you do
     not have any conflicts in the memory address of the EPROM and any
     other hardware.  Perhaps you have to prevent it from being mapped
     out by your BIOS settings. Or perhaps you have to shadow it with
     RAM. Maybe you put the code in the wrong half or wrong quarter of
     the EPROM. Maybe the access time of the EPROM is not low enough.
     You can also use the debug program under BIOS to examine the memory
     area in question.

  +o  If rom-scan says the EPROM is present but not active, then
     something prevented the BIOS from seeing it as a valid extension
     BIOS. This could be truncation of the EPROM window, maybe you have
     a larger EPROM in a slot meant for a smaller one. Maybe there is a
     checksum error in the EPROM due to some bits not properly
     programmed or the EPROM not being fast enough. In one case that we
     know of, the 3c503 network card, the ASIC actually returns 2 bytes
     of 80 80 in the end locations of the EPROM space. This apparently
     is a kind of signature. The makerom program in Etherboot
     compensates for this, but if the pattern is not 80 80, then the
     code needs to be modified.

  +o  If rom-scan says the EPROM is present and active, but BIOS does not
     see it, then perhaps the EPROM is located in an area that the BIOS
     does not scan. The range scanned is supposed to be 0xC0000 to
     0xEF800 in increments of 2kB but I have seen some BIOSes that
     continue the scan into the 0xF0000 page.


     Note that rom-scan will also detect other extension BIOSes mounted
     on your computer, for example VGA BIOSes and SCSI adapter BIOSes.
     This is normal.



     For PCI NICs there may be a different reason why the ROM does not
     work.  The PCI IDs of the ROM must match those of the NIC
     controller chip or the BIOS will ignore the ROM. The floppy version
     does not undergo this check since it isn't directly called from the
     BIOS. As mentioned before in the ``configuration instructions'',
     you must use the ROM image with the correct PCI IDs for your NIC.


  +o  Etherboot does not detect card. Are you using the right ROM image?
     Is the card properly seated in the computer? Can you see the card
     with other software? Are there any address conflicts with other
     hardware? Is the PCI id of the card one that is not known to
     Etherboot yet? In this case and where you think there is a bug in
     Etherboot, please contact the author with all details.

  +o  Etherboot detects card but hangs computer after detection. Some
     cards are booby traps while they are enabled. The typical offenders
     are NE2000s which will hang the bus if any access is made to the
     reset addresses while interrupts are active. You may need to do a
     hard reset of the computer, i.e. power down and up again before
     running Etherboot.
  +o  Etherboot detects card but does nothing after saying Searching for
     server. Check your network hardware. Did you select the right
     hardware interface (AUI, BNC, RJ45)? Is the cabling ok? If you have
     a Unix computer on the network and have root privileges, you could
     run tcpdump or ethereal looking for broadcast packets on the bootps
     port. If the requests are getting sent out but no replies are
     getting back, check your bootpd setup. Also check if the server has
     a route to the client.

  +o  Etherboot obtains IP address but fails to load file. Check the tftp
     server. Is the tagged image file installed? Is the file world
     readable? Is the path to the file allowed by the configuration of
     tftpd? Is the client denied by tcpwrapper rules?  Did you put the
     right home directory and boot filename in bootptab? If you are
     booting lots of clients, is inetd shutting down tftpd for being
     spawned too often? If so, you need to get a better inetd or a a
     dedicated tftpd that runs as an independent daemon.

  +o  Etherboot loads file via tftp but Linux fails to boot. This is a
     large category. Here are some suggestions:


  +o  You do not have a private copy of the /, /etc, /var, ...
     directories

  +o  Your /dev directory is missing entries for /dev/zero and/or
     /dev/null or is sharing device entries from a server that uses
     different major and minor numbers (i.e. a server that is not
     running Linux).

  +o  Your /lib directory is missing libraries (most notably libc* and/or
     libm*) or does not have the loader files ld*.so*

  +o  You neglected to run ldconfig to update /etc/ldconfig.cache or you
     do not have a configuration file for ldconfig.

  +o  Your /etc/inittab and/or /etc/rc.d/* files have not been customised
     for the clients. For example if you set the wrong IP address in
     your client's init files you could interfere with the server.

  +o  Your kernel is missing some crucial compile-time feature (such as
     NFS filesystem support, booting from the net, transname (optional),
     ELF file support, networking support, driver for your ethernet
     card).

  +o  Missing init executable (in one of the directories known by the
     kernel: /etc, /sbin, ?). Remember /sbin/init must be a real file,
     not a symlink.

  +o  Missing /etc/inittab

  +o  Missing /dev/tty?

  +o  Missing /bin/sh

  +o  System programs that insist on creating/writing to files outside of
     /var (mount and /etc/mtab* is the canonical example)


     The essence is that you must provide whatever is needed in the NFS
     root filesystem that your kernel needs to boot. This is somewhat
     distribution dependent. In the discussion mentioned above I solved
     the problem by making a copy of an existing root filesystem and
     modifying a few bits.  Be aware that some, if not all,
     distributions contain bugs in their layout that hinder diskless
     mounting so you will have to fix any problems that arise. An
     example was a directory in /usr/X11R6/lib that needed to be
     writable, however /usr was mounted read-only. Another common
     problem is the assumption in init scripts that /usr is available
     before NFS mounts are done and invoking programs under /usr/sbin.

  +o  Etherboot works fine and kernel starts but network interface
     doesn't work. Check your network configuration in the OS.
     Etherboot uses polled I/O and not interrupt I/O to fetch the
     images. So the IRQ line doesn't get exercised. This manifested
     itself in one case with a NIC that could netboot but network
     programs run afterwards couldn't receive any packets. It seemed to
     be a combination of a weak NIC IRQ line and a fussy motherboard.
     But the same thing could happen if say the IRQ is not set to where
     the software is expecting it. The image will load fine with the
     wrong IRQ but the software will not run properly. This is more of
     an issue with say DOS packet drivers, where the user has to specify
     the IRQ line than with Linux, which autoprobes.

  1. What do I need to build Etherboot?



     You need gcc, gas and objcopy, as well as any accompanying
     libraries and include files. Generally speaking on a package based
     system using RPM or DEB, you will need the C compiler package, the
     include file package, the C library package, the assembler package
     and the binutils package (this may include the assembler).  You
     will also need perl if you modify the file NIC or use a different
     RELOCADDR value in the Makefile than the default, and m4 if you
     modify this file userman.xsgml.


  2. I get an error from as saying data32 is an unknown directive or it
     has errors assembling loader.S or boot1a.s.



     Your gas is too old, upgrade to 2.9.5.


  3. I get warnings about ljmp *.



     They are harmless, you can ignore these. They are due to changes in
     the assembler syntax between gas versions. We could get rid of the
     warnings if we could easily detect which patches are installed in
     the version of gas you are using (it's not just a matter of
     detecting the gas version) but we'd rather just wait for the old
     gas versions to disappear since they are just warnings.


  4. The documentation talks about mknbi-linux and mknbi-dos. Where are
     they?



     These are distributed from the Etherboot web site
     <http://sourceforge.net/projects/etherboot/>.


  5. Why don't you provide prebuilt ROM images?



     Etherboot is constantly updated, and binary images would get out of
     date soon.  Binaries can lose any external indication of what
     release they were from. Old binaries might float around and create
     problems for users who are not aware that bugs have been fixed in
     newer versions. Also there are some user configurable options you
     might want to change.  For this reason, Etherboot is provided in
     source form for you to build.  However you might wish to check out
     rom-o-matic.net <http://rom-o-matic.net>, which is a site that
     makes ROM images for you on demand from specifications given to a
     web form and returns the image as the result of the form.



  99..22..  TTeessttiinngg EEtthheerrbboooott



  1. I put the ROM image on floppy like you wrote (cat bin/boot1a.bin
     bin32/foo.rom > /dev/fd0, or make bin32/foo.fd0) but the loader
     prints out an error.



     The floppy you use should be an error-free, preferably a recently
     formatted floppy. Do not trust new floppies; they have been known
     to lose their manufacturer formatting in storage. You don't need to
     put a filesystem of any sort on it, FAT or ext2 or otherwise.
     Another possible cause is that there are alignment differences
     between the drive used to write the floppy and that used on the
     target machine. Another possible reason is you are not using a 1.44
     MB floppy. The boot sector boot1a.s may not work on other floppy
     sizes. If you find this is the case, then try substituting
     floppyload.S for boot1a.s as the value of DISKLOADER in the
     Makefile. This boot sector should work on all floppy sizes (1.44M,
     720k, and even 1.2M and 360k if you can still find these), but
     beware of differences between drives, e.g. writing a 360k floppy in
     a 1.2M drive creates narrow tracks which may not overwrite previous
     contents.


  2. My network adapter is detected but I get no reply to the BOOTP/DHCP
     request.



     Do you have a BOOTP or DHCP server running on the same Ethernet
     segment?  On many operating systems the server is not enabled by
     default. Review the instructions in the Troubleshooting section.
     Another thing to note is that the BOOTP (or DHCP in fixed address
     mode) server will not reply if it does not know the network
     adapter's Ethernet address. Since the address may be hard to
     determine if it is not printed on the card or you do not have the
     adapter's setup program, you can copy it from Etherboot's startup
     message. Remember to restart the server if you have edited the
     config file and the server does not automatically reread when it
     discovers an updated config file.



     Another thing to check is that the BOOTP or DHCP server is allowed
     to receive the query. You may have some protection mechanism such
     as tcpwrappers or a firewall in front of it. As the booting
     computer does not have an IP address, the request will come from
     0.0.0.0 so your rules must allow through packets from this address.



     If the BOOTP or DHCP server is on another Ethernet segment, things
     get more complicated. You need to run a BOOTP or DHCP relay. You
     will probably also need to set the gateway field in the reply so
     that TFTP will work across the gateway. You should read a good
     explanation of how these work, in say, W. Richard Steven's book
     TCP/IP Illustrated.


  3. Etherboot gets the BOOTP/DHCP parameters but cannot find a TFTP
     server.



     Do you have a TFTP server installed and running and is it allowed
     to serve the client in question? For example the tcpwrapper rules
     may not allow TFTPD to respond to the IP address the booting
     computer is at. You should look at the log files on the server for
     any clues.


  4. The TFTP server is found but it replies Access violation.



     Access violation is a blanket reply for many different problems but
     essentially the TFTP server cannot give Etherboot the file
     requested. Did you put the file where TFTPD expects to find it,
     e.g. on a directory that is on its path? Did you make the file
     world readable? Case of the filename is important too. Check the
     log files on the TFTP server to see what the actual filename it
     tried to open was, sometimes directory prefixes are prepended to
     the name due to the program options specified.


  5. I made this kernel and put it in /tftpdir like you wrote but
     Etherboot says Unable to load file.



     Is the file a tagged image? You cannot use a ordinary kernel image,
     you must process it with mknbi-linux <mknbi.html> first.


  6. I have this proprietary boot ROM (e.g. LanWorks, PXE, etc) and I
     used mknbi-linux to make a tagged image, (or I got this tagged
     image from the LTSP project), but the boot ROM doesn't load it, or
     it fails to run.



     Tagged image format is specific to Etherboot and Netboot. It will
     not work with proprietary boot ROMs. You have to find out from the
     supplier what boot procedures you should use. For example, if you
     are using a LanWorks boot ROM, the information you need is here
     <http://www.3com.com/managedpc>.


  7. Why don't you use some standard format instead of tagged image
     format?



     First of all, tagged image format actually precedes many of the
     proprietary formats in use today. So we were there first. Secondly
     there is no acknowledged standard for the boot image format,
     although there are some contenders now. Perhaps some day there will
     be an open, widely-accepted format. Until then you have to aware
     that there are different ones out there.

  1. What network cards are supported?



     See an earlier section in this manual.


  2. I have a machine with the X processor and Y megabytes of memory.
     What can I expect to run on it?



     Please note that these estimates are approximate:


  +o  On a 386 with at least 4MB of memory you can boot Linux. With 4MB
     perhaps only a few telnet sessions are possible. With 8MB you might
     be able to run a text based web browser like Lynx or W3M. You can
     also run firewalls such as floppyfw <http://www.zelow.no/floppyfw>.

  +o  On a 486 with 16MB of memory you can run X to make an X-terminal.

  +o  On a Pentium with 32MB of memory you can run an X-terminal and some
     applications locally, say perhaps printing, daemons to control
     devices, etc.

  +o  On anything faster and with more memory you could perhaps do
     distributed computation, e.g. a Beowulf cluster.



  99..44..  BBoooottiinngg LLiinnuuxx



  1. The kernel loads but it cannot configure the network device.



     Did you compile the network adaptor driver into the kernel? Is the
     network adaptor at an address that is probed by the driver? If not,
     perhaps you need to provide some kernel parameters to help it find
     the hardware.
  2. The kernel loads but it cannot mount a root filesystem, then it
     asks me to insert a floppy.



     Did you build the kernel with the root on NFS option? You cannot
     use a stock kernel from a distribution. Another reason might be you
     are running a recent kernel (2.2.18 and higher in the 2.2 series,
     not known from what release number in the 2.4 series) where IP
     Autoconfiguration is not enabled by default. You need to add
     ip=dhcp or ip=bootp to the kernel parameters (this requires
     mknbi-1.1 and above). Or you can use the append= option in
     mknbi-1.0 to add this option.


  3. The kernel loads but it cannot find a NFS server for the root
     filesystem.



     Do you have a NFS server running and is it allowed to serve this
     client?  NFS is actually several services. On Linux at least you
     need: nfsd (either kernel or userland version), rpc.mountd and
     portmapper. Check if the tcpwrappers config file is allowing
     portmapper to receive the request.  Look at the log files for
     clues. Did we already mention that log files are your friends?


  4. The root filesystem mounts but it says something about not being
     able to open an initial console. Or alternatively, various services
     complain about not being able to write to the filesystem.



     A common mistake in Linux NFS servers is to put extra spaces in
     /etc/exports. Please see the NFS FAQ <http://nfs.sourceforge.net/>
     for frequently answered questions about Linux NFS services.



     Please review the Troubleshooting section for what is required on
     this root filesystem. The situation is complicated by the fact that
     there are many possible ways of setting this up, including using a
     root filesystem that is on ramdisk. If you wish to avoid many of
     the troubles, try using a packaged solution such as LTSP
     <http://www.ltsp.org/>.


  5. What is the recommended way of setting up the NFS root?



     There is no one true way, but several approaches. Network booting
     is a tool and a very flexible one.  Here are just a few
     suggestions:


     a. You can make a separate NFS root for each client, but share the
        sharable files between clients using hard links to minimise disk
        space requirements. This is the approach I took in my tutorial
        <diskless.html>. I used this because I was lazy, I have only a
        couple of diskless clients and I could copy the files from an
        existing distribution. Note that these scripts may need changing
        for your distribution, I used it on a RedHat 5.2 system long
        ago. If you don't feel up to understanding what needs to be
        fixed, see the next item.
     b. You could use the packaged solution from LTSP
        <http://www.ltsp.org/>, which creates a shareable NFS root for
        multiple clients.

     c. August Hoerandl describes his approach
        <http://elina.htlw16.ac.at/~hoerandl/nfs-root/> which uses a
        ramdisk for the initial startup, and then merges in a readonly
        NFS filesystem.

     d. It is rumoured that the Debian distribution
        <http://www.debian.org/> has a package called diskless that
        contains Perl scripts to create such a filesystem.



     If you have an approach which you think the world should know
     about, please send the URL of a web page that describes it to me
     <mailto:ken_yap@users.sourceforge.net>.



  99..55..  RRuunnnniinngg XX



  1. I tried to run X on the client but it aborted.



     Remember that the config files used by the X server should pertain
     to the client's video adapter and display hardware. If you used a
     LTSP <http://www.ltsp.org/> package, please review the
     configuration directions. If you used the copy files from server
     solution, then you need to customise the X server configuration.
     Another thing that may cause the server to abort is lack of a mouse
     device.


  2. X -query server runs but all I get is a gray stippled screen.



     Either you don't have an XDM server running on the server machine
     or it is not allowed to serve this client. In the latter case check
     XDM's Xaccess file, because for security reasons, the ability for
     clients to connect is usually disabled.


  3. When I am logged in using an X-terminal, I find that the floppy
     drive, sound card and name of the computer are those of the
     server!?



     This is to be expected! This is exactly how an X-terminal works.
     You are indeed logged onto the server and the client just provides
     display (screen) and input device (keyboard and mouse) services to
     the application. This is one of the beauties of the X Windowing
     system model, it's _n_e_t_w_o_r_k _t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t.


  4. So how do I run applications on the client? I have this (smartcard
     reader, printer, sound card, etc) program that must execute
     locally.


     The client can be configured to allow you to run programs locally.
     What you have to do is either start the application from the init
     scripts run during bootup, as would be the case for the printer and
     sound daemons mentioned later; or to start a shell interpreter on
     the client, either through an interactive login to the client or a
     remote execution of a command from the server to the client. Common
     methods are rsh (insecure) and ssh (better).


  5. X applications cannot find (some) fonts.



     Do you have an X font server (XFS) running on the server machine,
     is it allowed to serve this client, and has the client been told to
     use the font server? The last point is usually configured in the
     XF86Config file, or by a xset command to modify the font path after
     logging in.



     Also note that RedHat (and possibly other distributions) has made
     XFS by default serve only the local machine using a Unix socket.
     You need to modify the startup script to tell XFS to use a TCP/IP
     socket.


  6. How much CPU power and memory do I need on the client? On the
     server?



     It depends on the configuration. There are two major cases: where
     the client is an X-terminal, and not much more; and where the
     client is configured to run applications locally.



     An X server will fit in 16MB of memory, and 32MB is quite adequate.
     Performance depends on the CPU, video card and your expectations.
     An old Pentium 200 with a PCI video card does very well, but if you
     are not fussy, a high-end 486 with a VLB video card can be
     satisfying too.



     If you want to run apps locally, well how long is a piece of
     string?  Netscape will need say another 16MB. It all depends.
     Whatever you do, it's worth trimming down on the services you run
     on the client. Don't run more virtual consoles than you need and
     don't run unneeded daemons.



     As for the server, in the X-terminal case this has all the
     applications running on it, so it should be adequate for the
     multiuser aspect. A high-end Pentium, with 64 MB of memory to start
     with, and between 8 and 16MB for each extra client is a good
     starting point. It will also depend on your mix of client access,
     statistically perhaps not everybody will be running at the same
     time. Remember that you don't have to have one big server for all
     your clients, you can and you should distribute the load across
     servers.

  1. How can I print to a printer attached to a diskless client?



     There is a server program called p910nd
     <http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/p910nd/> at the Etherboot web
     site (and modified versions of it at LTSP <http://www.ltsp.org/>)
     that funnels data from a TCP/IP connection to the printer port. You
     can instruct lpd or CUPS <http://www.cups.org/> on the server to
     send jobs across the network to p910nd.


  2. How can I output sound on the client?



     There is a package called virtualfs <http://www.solucorp.qc.ca>
     that proxies the sound devices across the network. It can also
     proxy the floppy drive.



     Another solution is EsounD
     <http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/EsounD.html>



     You may wish to check the LTSP <http://www.ltsp.org/> site and
     mailing lists for other proposed solutions.


  3. How can I access the floppy on the client?



     Besides virtualfs mentioned above, recent distributions of mtools
     <http://wauug.erols.com/pub/knaff/mtools/> have a floppyd. This
     only works with the mtools utilities though.

  1. Where are the instructions for booting FreeBSD?



     For now, there is just a short document in the doc directory.
     Better versions of this document depend on contributions from the
     FreeBSD community, I am unable to test FreeBSD because I don't run
     it.

  1. I want to boot FreeDOS.

     The new mknbi utility supports creating tagged images from FreeDOS
     kernels now.  See the man page <mknbi.html> for details.  FreeDOS
     is a moving target and the layout of the kernel image or other
     things may have changed so you would need to be well acquainted
     with FreeDOS. Please send any corrections to me.


  2. I cannot boot DR-DOS 7.03.



     There is some difference between the DR-DOS 7.03 and 7.02 bootblock
     that causes it not to boot. But a 7.02 bootblock works just as well
     with the DR-DOS 7.03 kernel, so you can substitute that. There are
     instructions to extract the bootblock in the AT netbooting document
     <atnetboot.html>.


  3. DOS dies when I load HIMEM.SYS.



     Use the /testmem:off option to prevent HIMEM from scribbling over
     the ramdisk which is the floppy A:.


  4. How do I make A: my real floppy again after booting is complete?



     Use the rmrd.com program supplied with mknbi <mknbi.html>.


  5. I want to use the real floppy at the same time I am using the
     ramdisk image of the boot floppy.



     The --harddisk option of mknbi is intended for this. It causes your
     boot drive to be C:, so you can use A: for the real floppy. See the
     man page <mknbi.html> for more details


  6. I want to boot Windows.



     I pass on this one, as I do not have (by choice) any Windows
     systems running on my computers. Perhaps others can contribute to
     this section. However I gather that it is only possible on
     Windows95A, as other versions don't have the necessary support for
     diskless booting.

  1. Where can I get an EPROM made?



     Depending on where you live, you might find a supplier listed on
     the Commercial Links page. Another possibility is to seek the help
     of someone working in a university or industrial lab who has an
     EPROM programmer.  If you are handy with hardware, you could buy a
     kit or build your own.  There are links to kit suppliers in the
     Commercial Links part of the home page.



     Some high end adapters, for example the 3Com and Intel ones, accept
     an EEPROM in the socket. This can be programmed in-situ using
     utility programs, some of which or information about are under the
     contrib directory in the Etherboot distribution.



     Finally some recent motherboard have flash BIOSes which contain
     space where an extension BIOS such as Etherboot can be inserted.
     The Phoenix Award BIOSes can be modified using a program called
     cbrom.exe possibly here <http://www.ping.be/bios>. It is also
     reputed to live here
     <http://www.boardrunner.com/download/utility/utility.htm>. Or do a
     Web search for it. No success has been reported for AMI BIOSes.
     Dirk von Suchodoletz maintains a list of successes and failures
     here <http://goe.net/anleitungen/award_board.html>.

     Here is some text contributed by Dirk von Suchodoletz. He hopes to
     put it on a web site someday:









































     ___________________________________________________________________
     6.4 Using your mainboard's BIOS to integrate etherboot-code

     Newer mainboards that have an AWARD-BIOS can use etherboot without
     separate EPROMS and therefore without the necessity of having a
     EPROM-programmer[?]. (Heinrich Rebehn wishes to add: Flashing the BIOS
     is always a (small) risk. Flashing with unsupported, hacked BIOS image
     is *dangerous* and may render your PC unbootable. If you don't
     have access to a PROM burner you should stay away from experimenting.) In
     order to do this, you need 2 software tools: awdflash.exe, which should be
     included in your mainboard package, and cbrom.exe, which is an OEM-tool
     that allows modifications of the BIOS. awdflash.exe reads and writes
     the flashrom content, whereas cbrom.exe is used to analyse the content
     of the AWARD BIOS image. cbrom.exe can also add code to the BIOS image
     or remove components. This way you can easily integrate etherboot into
     your mainboards without even opening the PC's case.

     After the BIOS image has been saved (e.g. as bios.bin), or in case the
     current version of the BIOS has been copied from the board manufacturer's
     website, 'cbrom bios.bin /d' shows how much space is left on the image
     for your code.

     As the flashrom holds the compressed BIOS, cbrom will also compress
     the code when adding it to the BIOS. Therefore, 8 to 20 kbyte of free
     memory is needed, depending on the network adapter's driver. In case not
     enough memory is left, unneeded BIOS components can be removed from the
     BIOS image to regain space: the manufacturer's logo or the Symbios/NCR
     SCSI-code are note needed for diskless systems. 'cbrom bios.bin
     /[pci|ncr|logo|isa] release' will remove those unnecessary components.

     The command line "cbrom bios.bin /[pci|isa] bootimg.rom [D000:0]" adds
     the compiled etherboot code to the bios. bootimg.rom is the code we
     would use to burn onto EEPROMs in other cases. Depending on your network
     card, either the pci or isa options have to be used. With isa cards
     you have to tell cbrom to which RAM location the code will be extracted
     at boot time. Attention: Compile the etherboot with the -DASK_BOOT or
     -DEMERGENCYDISKBOOT option to be able to access a disk. The code added
     by cbrom will be executed before the computer seeks for a boot disk
     or floppy.

     6.5 Booting with a DOS executable (COM) file

     If the computer has to be used with more than one operating systems,
     for example using the computer as an X-Terminal in addition to the
     already installed NT on the harddrive, etherboot has to be used with
     the compile-time option -DASK_BOOT. In case hardware-conflicts between
     Windows NT and the installed EPROM exist, creating DOS Executables
     (e.g. using 'make rtl8139.com') can provide a useful remedy. Those DOS
     Executables are comparable in their functionality to .rom images and
     can be used as substitutes.

     In case an existing DOS-bootsector, stored in BOOTSECT.DOS, cannot be
     used, creating one has to be done by formatting and installing a harddrive
     using DOS before installing NT (see Win-NT Multiboot-HOWTO). In addition
     the DOS system files are needed (IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, or KERNEL.SYS
     when using Freedos) and have to be copied into the directory of the
     NT loader. If using Autoexec.bat to start the .COM file is desired,
     either the particular COMMAND.COM has to be provided or the etherboot
     file needs to be renamed as COMMAND.COM. This file will then be started
     instead of the DOS-Shell which is useful for avoiding unwanted user
     interaction. Afterwards a line has to be added to BOOT.INI as if DOS
     was to be booted:

     [boot loader]
     timeout=20
     default=C:\bootsect.dos #add this line if dhcp/tftp should be default action
     [operating systems]
     multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\WINNT="Windows NT Workstation, Version 4.0"
     [VGA-Modus]" /basevideo /sos
     C:\bootsect.dos="DHCP/TFTP (Linux diskless via etherboot)" #our boot option
     ___________________________________________________________________



  And here are some comments by Rapp Informatik Systeme GmbH about
  cbrom.exe versions:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  Some more remarks for cbrom..

  There are several version numbers of cbrom.exe p.e. 1.x and 2.x.
  and there is a cbrom called cbrom6.exe. First cbrom.exe with Version
  1.x (newest 1.32) is for Award Bios Version 4.5x  and cbrom6.exe is
  for Award Bios Version 6.xx.

  So because it seems a lot people become confused and use cbrom 1.x
  for the new 6.x Bios Award merged this together to a cbrom.exe  with
  Version number 2.x ( newest know 2.04) witch now runs on Award 4.5x and
  6.xx Bioses.

  Now how to find cbrom.exe. Different 1.x Versions of cbrom.exe
  could be found on the net, cbrom6.exe seems to be gone. It seems
  that Award/Phoenix do all that cbrom is deleted from servers of board
  manufactures. So cbrom.exe Vers 2.04 is not available on the net.
  If somebody need this please try to send a demand question to the list -
  I hope somebody will mail it to you.

  2. How do I enable the ROM socket on my network adapter? There are no
     jumpers on the card.



     These jumperless cards need a card-specific utility program to
     enable the ROM.  Normally the manufacturer supplies it on a
     diskette or CDROM.  You lost the diskette? If you know the
     manufacturer, you might be able to get the program from their
     website. You have a mystery card? Well the first thing to do is to
     identify the card. If it is an ISA card and made in Taiwan or China
     it's almost certainly a NE2000 clone. For some information, try
     here <http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/9247/NIC/>. If
     it's a PCI card, then either the BIOS or the Linux PCI Utilities
     <http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mj/pciutils.html> should be able
     to tell you the manufacturer and device IDs, which you can then
     look up to convert to names.


  3. I would like to boot my laptop diskless from a floppy containing
     Etherboot.



     The problem is that laptops these days use PCMCIA network adapter
     cards.  These in turn connect to the PCMCIA controller when docked.
     To be able to communicate with the PCMCIA card, Etherboot would
     first have to talk to the PCMCIA controller. Until somebody writes
     the code to do this...  Booting from disk is different because the
     kernel will load the PCMCIA controller code from disk first. You
     could always put a Linux kernel on the boot floppy.



  99..1100..  DDrriivveerrss



  1. There is no Etherboot driver for my network adapter. Can you write
     me one?



     If I were independently wealthy and had nothing else to do in life,
     sure!  But unfortunately I have a day job and Etherboot is a hobby.
     A couple of the drivers were written for pay and the others were
     written by volunteers. Perhaps you might like to volunteer?  If you
     have a good grasp of C, and understand basic hardware concepts, it
     is quite doable, and not nearly as difficult as writing a Linux
     device driver.  See the developer manual <devman.html>. You will
     have the reward of understanding hardware intimately and seeing
     your work benefit users worldwide.



     If you are a commercial entity, you might consider assigning staff
     or hiring a volunteer to write the driver. You get the benefit of
     the rest of the Etherboot code infrastructure and users worldwide
     get to appreciate your contribution.  Bear in mind the ``GPL''
     license conditions, of course.  NIC manufacturers note, this may be
     one way to attract users to your hardware products. NIC users note,
     petition your NIC manufacturer to support Etherboot.


  2. I see that my network adapter is supported in Linux but not in
     Etherboot. Can I use the Linux driver in Etherboot? Or maybe you
     can adapt the Linux source for me. I can send you the Linux driver
     source if you just say the word.



     No, the structure of Linux and Etherboot drivers are quite
     different.  There are several reasons: Linux drivers are more
     complicated and written to give good performance, whereas Etherboot
     drivers are written to be simple. Linux drivers are interrupt
     driven, whereas Etherboot drivers are polling. Linux drivers have
     an elaborate support structure, whereas Etherboot drivers are
     fairly self-standing. Finally Etherboot drivers have a difficult
     constraint on the amount of memory available to it, about 48kB near
     the top of 640kB.



     But... you can use Linux drivers as a source of reverse-engineering
     information. Several of the drivers in Etherboot were adapted from
     Linux drivers. But don't send me the driver source; see previous
     FAQ about volunteering. And I have the latest Linux source anyway,
     doesn't everyone?

  The boot code from FreeBSD is under the BSD license. The code taken
  from the Linux PCI subsystem and Linux NIC drivers are under GPL. Some
  source files have been put under GPL by their authors.  Hence the
  Etherboot distribution is in general under the GPL, but you may use
  parts of it derived from FreeBSD under FreeBSD rules.  Simply
  speaking, the GPL says that if you distribute a binary derived from
  Etherboot code (this includes boot ROMs) you have to provide, or
  promise to provide on demand, the source code.  The full conditions of
  the GPL are specified in the file COPYING.



  Here are the copyright details of the source, file by file:

  under the GPL or BSD license. For other licenses see the respective source
  for details. The BSD files are those inherited from FreeBSD netboot. The
  GPL files are in general either from Linux or have been explicitly put
