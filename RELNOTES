Etherboot 5.3.12 aka 5.4RC3 (Release Date 2005-01-03)

This release is for final testing.  I hope this will be the pentultimate
release candidate. Unless there are brown paper bag bugs, the next
release candidate will become 5.4.0 by renumbering.

.z?rom images now work; they were broken in .11.

Removed etherboot(-pci)?.* rule because there are too many drivers and
the image will no longer fit in memory. I don't want to choose a subset
of drivers as everybody will have different preferences. So I'm going to
piss off everybody equally by deleting the rule. Use the multiple driver
rule (driver1--driver2--...) and select your own subset of drivers.

To generate ISO images you will to get need syslinux and/or isolinux
separately. Google for them. If you have a very old BIOS and .liso
images don't work you may wish to try adding the -s option of syslinux
as a last resort.

It should be possible to compile Etherboot with gcc >= 3.3.3, including
gcc 3.4.x now that a couple of bugs have been tracked down. Please mail
reports of success or failure to the etherboot-users list, together with
the versions of gcc and binutils used.

gcc 2.x is not supported anymore. You need at least gcc 3.0.x to compile
etherboot.

Menuing using DHCP options (mknbi/menu.c) has been removed.

We know that these things do not work; they are being worked on:

return from chained programs like menus (might be mknbi problem)
return from .com programs
support for LinuxBIOS ELF files (not mkelf images)

As of Etherboot 5.3.8:

There is no longer a default target for make.  You must specify an
argument to make. Help text is now provided to indicate possible make
targets.

binutils-2.14 is no longer needed in order to compile images. The
symbolsrec feature is not used, so older binutils (ld) should work.

[ PXE is export is now on by default as of Etherboot 5.3.7 ]
To enable PXELINUX support in Etherboot-5.3.7, you will need to
enable 	-DPXE_IMAGE -DPXE_EXPORT in src/Config 

    # Etherboot as a PXE ROM
    CFLAGS+=	-DPXE_IMAGE -DPXE_EXPORT

You will also need to configure your server to provide a pxelinux.0
loader file, kernel and initrd images, and a pxelinux.cfg directory with
a appropriate configuration spec files.

See the PXELINUX home page at:

    http://syslinux.zytor.com/pxe.php

for more information.

In order to create .liso images (which are .iso images which contain
legacy floppy emulation code), you will need to have the packages
mtools-3.9.9 or later, and syslinux-2.08 or later installed on your
system. These packages are available in various locations and formats.
Join and ask on the etherboot-users mailing list if you need help
finding them.
