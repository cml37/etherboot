Etherboot 5.0.0

This is a production release. Some important notes have been retained
from the 4.7 development series. Please read the documentation for more
details.

mknbi is now distributed separately from Etherboot to allow independent
development.

Etherboot should make PnP ROMs properly now. A long-standing bug in the
headers has been tracked down. However some faulty old BIOSes are out
there so I have written a Perl script swapdevids.pl to switch the header
around if necessary. You'll have to experiment with it both ways to find
out which works. Or you could dump a ROM image that works (e.g. RPL, PXE
ROM) using the Perl script disrom.pl. The fields to look at are Device
(base, sub, interface) Type. It should be 02 00 00, but some BIOSes may
want 00 00 02 due to an ambiguity in the original specification.

You need gas 2.9.5 or later to be able to assemble loader.S and
boot1a.s.

It has been reported that RH 7.0's gcc ("gcc 2.96") generates buggy code
when compiling Etherboot. Please do not use it. If you must compile on
RH 7.0, use kgcc.

If you are booting kernel 2.2.18 or .19, you MUST specify ip=dhcp (or
bootp or one of the other options, see kernel Documentation/nfsroot.txt)
if you want the kernel to do IP autoconfiguration, even though you have
included the option in your kernel build. The alternative is to use
ip=rom and then the kernel will use values passed down by Etherboot.
For me at least, kernel IP autoconfiguration is instant and any concerns
about it slowing down the booting are misplaced.
