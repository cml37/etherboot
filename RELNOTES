Etherboot 5.1.9

There is a bug in the Perl supplied with RH9 (and possibly RH8). It
assumes UTF-8 even with the use bytes pragma. Either get an updated Perl
package or set LANG to en_US (without the .UTF-8 suffix).

Lots of changes from 5.0.

Support for Itaniums and Opterons now.

Major rework by Eric Biederman to include multicast support.

Builtin menuing support has been removed.
