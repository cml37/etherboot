# Config for Etherboot/32
#
# Do not delete the tag OptionDescription and /OptionDescription
# It is used to automatically generate the documentation.
#
# <OptionDescription>
#	User interaction options:
#
#	-DASK_BOOT=n
#			Ask "Boot from Network or from Local? " at startup,
#			timeout after n seconds (0 = no timeout); this
#			can be done in a more generic way by using the
#			IMAGE_MENU, but it requires that the "bootp"
#			server is accessible, even when booting locally.
#			If unset, boot immediately using the default.
#	-DANS_DEFAULT=ANS_NETWORK
#			Assume Network to previous question
#			(alternative: ANS_LOCAL) on timeout or Return key
#			See etherboot.h for prompt and answer strings.
#	-DBAR_PROGRESS
#			Use rotating bar instead of sequential dots
#			to indicate an IP packet transmitted.
#	-DDELIMITERLINES
#			Print a line of = characters at the start
#			and also just before starting an image.
#	-DSIZEINDICATOR
#			Update a running total of the amount of code
#			loaded so far, in kilobytes.
#
#	Boot autoconfiguration protocol options:
#
#	-DNO_DHCP_SUPPORT
#			Use BOOTP instead of DHCP.
#	-DRARP_NOT_BOOTP
#			Use RARP instead of BOOTP/DHCP.
#	-DREQUIRE_VCI_ETHERBOOT
#			Require an encapsulated Vendor Class Identifier
#			of "Etherboot" in the DHCP reply
#			Requires DHCP support.
#	-DALLOW_ONLY_ENCAPSULATED
#			Ignore Etherboot-specific options that are not within
#			the Etherboot encapsulated options field.  This option
#			should be enabled unless you have a legacy DHCP server
#			configuration from the bad old days before the use of
#			encapsulated Etherboot options.
#
#	NIC tuning parameters:
#
#	-DALLMULTI
#			Turns on multicast reception in the NICs.
#
#	Boot tuning parameters:
#
#	-DCONGESTED
#			Turns on packet retransmission.  Use it on a
#			congested network, where the normal operation
#			can't boot the image.
#	-DBACKOFF_LIMIT
#			Sets the maximum RFC951 backoff exponent to n.
#			Do not set this unreasonably low, because on networks
#			with many machines they can saturate the link
#			(the delay corresponding to the exponent is a random
#			time in the range 0..3.5*2^n seconds).  Use 5 for a
#			VERY small network (max. 2 minutes delay), 7 for a
#			medium sized network (max. 7.5 minutes delay) or 10
#			for a really huge network with many clients, frequent
#			congestions (max. 1  hour delay).  On average the
#			delay time will be half the maximum value.  If in
#			doubt about the consequences, use a larger value.
#			Also keep in mind that the number of retransmissions
#			is not changed by this setting, so the default of 20
#			may no longer be appropriate.  You might need to set
#			MAX_ARP_RETRIES, MAX_BOOTP_RETRIES, MAX_TFTP_RETRIES
#			and MAX_RPC_RETRIES to a larger value.
#
#	Boot device options:
#
#	-DCAN_BOOT_DISK
#			Can boot from floppy/hd if bootimage matches the
#			pattern "/dev/[fhs]d*".
#	-DPC_FLOPPY
#			Support direct PC flopy controller access,
#			instead of going through the BIOS
#	-DIDE_DISK
#			Support direct ide disk controller access,
#			instead of going through the BIOS
#	-DTRY_FLOPPY_FIRST
#			If > 0, tries that many times to read the boot
#			sector from a floppy drive before booting from
#			ROM. If successful, does a local boot.
#			It assumes the floppy is bootable.
#			Requires -DCAN_BOOT_DISK.
#	-DEMERGENCYDISKBOOT
#			If no BOOTP server can be found, then boot from
#			local disk. The accessibility of the TFTP server
#			has no effect, though! So configure your BOOTP
#			server properly. You should probably reduce
#			MAX_BOOTP_RETRIES to a small number like 3.
#
#	Boot image options:
#
#	-DTAGGED_IMAGE
#			Add tagged image kernel boot support (recommended).
#	-DAOUT_IMAGE
#			Add a.out kernel boot support (generic).
#	-DELF_IMAGE
#			Add generic ELF kernel boot support (recommended).
#	-DEL64F_IMAGE
#			Add generic ELF64 kernel boot support (useful for > 4GB disks).
#	-DWINCE_IMAGE
#			Add the ability to boot WINCE.... now only sis630 OK!
#       -DFREEBSD_PXEEMU
#                       Add the ability to boot PXE images... only FreeBSD supported
#       -DX86_BOOTSECTOR_IMAGE
#                       Add the ability to boot 512 byte x86 boot sectors
#	-DIMAGE_MULTIBOOT
#			Add Multiboot image support (currently only
#			for ELF images).
#			Without this, generic ELF support is selected.
#	-DIMAGE_FREEBSD
#			Add FreeBSD image loading support (requires at least
#			-DAOUT_IMAGE and/or -DELF_IMAGE).
#	-DFREEBSD_KERNEL_ENV
#			Pass in FreeBSD kernel environment
#	-DAOUT_LYNX_KDI
#			Add Lynx a.out KDI support
#       -DMULTICAST_LEVEL1
#			Support for sending multicast packets
#       -DMULTICAST_LEVEL2
#			Support for receiving multicast packets
#	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTP
#			If defined, boots by TFTP (recommended).
#	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_NFS
#			If defined, boots from a NFS mount and disables
#			TFTP loading. Default is DOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTP
#			if neither is defined.
#       -DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_SLAM
#			If defined, boots via Scalable Local Area Multicast.
#       -DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTM
#			If defined, enables booting via TFTP Multicast mode.
#
#	Console options:
#
#	-DCONSOLE_CRT
#			Set for CRT console (default if nothing else is set).
#	-DCONSOLE_SERIAL
#			Set for serial console.
#	-DCONSOLE_DUAL
#			Set for CRT and serial console, see comment at
#			-DANSIESC and -DGFX.
#	-DCOMCONSOLE
#			Set port, e.g. 0x3F8.
#	-DCONSPEED
#			Set speed, e.g. 57600.
#	-DCOMPARM
#			Set Line Control Register value for data bits, stop
#			bits and parity. See a National Semiconditor 8250/
#			16450/16550 data sheet for bit meanings.
#			If undefined, defaults to 0x03 = 8N1.
#	-DCOMPRESERVE
#			Ignore COMSPEED and COMPARAM and instead preserve
#			the com port parameters from the previous user
#			of the com port.  Examples of previous user are a BIOS
#			that implements console redirection, lilo and LinuxBIOS.
#			This makes it trivial to keep the serial port
#			speed setting in sync between multiple users.
#			You set the speed in the first user and the
#			rest follow along.
#
#	BIOS interface options:
#
#	-DPCBIOS
#			Compile in support for the normal pcbios
#	-DLINUXBIOS
#			Compile in support for LinuxBIOS
#
#	-DBBS_BUT_NOT_PNP_COMPLIANT
#			Some BIOSes claim to be PNP but they don't conform
#			to the BBS spec which specifies that ES:DI must
#			point to the string $PnP on entry. This option
#			works around those. This option must be added to
#			LCONFIG.
#	-DNO_DELAYED_INT
#			Take control as soon as BIOS detects the ROM.
#			Normally hooks onto INT18H or INT19H. Use only if you
#			have a very non-conformant BIOS as it bypasses
#			BIOS initialisation of devices. This only works for
#			legacy ROMs, i.e. PCI_PNP_HEADER not defined.
#			This option was formerly called NOINT19H.
#	-DBOOT_INT18H
#			Etherboot normally hooks onto INT19H for legacy ROMs.
#			You can choose to hook onto INT18H (BASIC interpreter
#			entry point) instead. This entry point is used when
#			all boot devices have been exhausted. This option must
#			be added to LCONFIG.
#	-DCONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
#			Define this for PCI BIOSes that do not implement
#			BIOS32 or not correctly. Normally not needed.
#			Only works for BIOSes of a certain era.
#	-DCONFIG_TSC_CURRTICKS
#			Uses the processor time stamp counter instead of reading
#			the BIOS time counter.  This allows Etherboot to work
#			even without a BIOS.  This only works on late model
#			486s and above.
#	-DPXELOADER_KEEP_UNDI
#			For implementation later with UNDI.
#	-DIBM_L40
#			This option uses the 0x92 method of controlling
#			A20 instead of the traditional method of using the
#			keyboard controller. An explanation of A20 is here:
#			http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/A20.html
#			This occurs on MCA, EISA and some embedded boards,
#			and sometimes with the Fast Gate A20 option on some
#			BIOSes.
#			Enable this only if you are sure of what you are doing.
#
#	Obscure options you probably don't need to touch:
#
#	-DPOWERSAVE
#			Halt the processor when waiting for keyboard input
#			which saves power while waiting for user interaction.
#			Good for compute clusters and VMware emulation.
#			But may not work for all CPUs.
#	-DT503_AUI
#			Use AUI by default on 3c503 cards.
#	-DMOVEROM
#			If your motherboard does not cache adapter memory
#			space, then this option can speed up loading of
#			compressed BOOT-Prom images. It has no effect on
#			uncompressed images. Unless you are very tight on
#			free space, you will usually want to define this
#			option.  This option must be added to LCONFIG!
#			(recommended).
#	-DUSE_LOWMEM_BUFFER
#			Define to put some buffers below 0x10000 which
#			may interfere with other programs.
#			(Don't use, deprecated.)
#       -DRELOCATE
#			After starting etherboot relocate to the top
#			of memory.  This allows loading fairly arbitrary
#			rom images.  This doesn't work with all drivers yet.
